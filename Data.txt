THE BOY WHO LIVED 
r. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were 
proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank 
you very much. They were the last people you’d expect to be in volved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn’t 
hold with such nonsense. 
Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which 
made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, al though he did have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin 
and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which 
came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over 
garden fences, spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a small 
son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere. 
The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a 
secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. 
M
CHAPTER ONE 
 2 
They didn’t think they could bear it if anyone found out about the 
Potters. Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley’s sister, but they hadn’t met 
for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn’t have a 
sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as 
unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to 
think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the 
street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but 
they had never even seen him. This boy was another good reason 
for keeping the Potters away; they didn’t want Dudley mixing with 
a child like that. 
When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday 
our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to 
suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his 
most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily 
as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair. 
None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the 
window. 
At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked 
Mrs. Dursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but 
missed, because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing 
his cereal at the walls. “Little tyke,” chortled Mr. Dursley as he left 
the house. He got into his car and backed out of number four’s 
drive. 
It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of 
something peculiar — a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr. 
Dursley didn’t realize what he had seen — then he jerked his head 
around to look again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner 
THE BOY WHO LIVED 
 3 
of Privet Drive, but there wasn’t a map in sight. What could he 
have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the light. Mr. 
Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in 
his mirror. It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive — no, 
looking at the sign; cats couldn’t read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley 
gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind. As he 
drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of 
drills he was hoping to get that day. 
But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by 
something else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he 
couldn’t help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely 
dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn’t bear 
people who dressed in funny clothes — the getups you saw on 
young people! He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. He 
drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a 
huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr. Dursley was enraged to see that a 
couple of them weren’t young at all; why, that man had to be older 
than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The nerve of 
him! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some 
silly stunt — these people were obviously collecting for something . . . yes, that would be it. The traffic moved on and a few 
minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot, 
his mind back on drills. 
Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office 
on the ninth floor. If he hadn’t, he might have found it harder to 
concentrate on drills that morning. He didn’t see the owls swoop-

 4 
ing past in broad daylight, though people down in the street did; 
they pointed and gazed open-mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime. Mr. 
Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl-free morning. He 
yelled at five different people. He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more. He was in a very good mood 
until lunchtime, when he thought he’d stretch his legs and walk 
across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery. 
He’d forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a 
group of them next to the baker’s. He eyed them angrily as he 
passed. He didn’t know why, but they made him uneasy. This 
bunch were whispering excitedly, too, and he couldn’t see a single 
collecting tin. It was on his way back past them, clutching a large 
doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words of what they were 
saying. 
“The Potters, that’s right, that’s what I heard —” 
“— yes, their son, Harry —” 
Mr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He looked back at 
the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but 
thought better of it. 
He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, 
snapped at his secretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, 
and had almost finished dialing his home number when he 
changed his mind. He put the receiver back down and stroked his 
mustache, thinking . . . no, he was being stupid. Potter wasn’t such 
an unusual name. He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry. Come to think of it, he wasn’t even 
sure his nephew was called Harry. He’d never even seen the boy. It

might have been Harvey. Or Harold. There was no point in worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so upset at any mention of her 
sister. He didn’t blame her — if he’d had a sister like that . . . but all 
the same, those people in cloaks . . . 
He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon 
and when he left the building at five o’clock, he was still so worried 
that he walked straight into someone just outside the door. 
“Sorry,” he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost 
fell. It was a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man 
was wearing a violet cloak. He didn’t seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground. On the contrary, his face split into a 
wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare, 
“Don’t be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating, this happy, happy day!” 
And the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and 
walked off. 
Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a 
complete stranger. He also thought he had been called a Muggle, 
whatever that was. He was rattled. He hurried to his car and set off 
for home, hoping he was imagining things, which he had never 
hoped before, because he didn’t approve of imagination. 
As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he 
saw — and it didn’t improve his mood — was the tabby cat he’d 
spotted that morning. It was now sitting on his garden wall. He 
was sure it was the same one; it had the same markings around its 
eyes. 
“Shoo!” said Mr. Dursley loudly. 
CHAPTER ONE 
 6 
The cat didn’t move. It just gave him a stern look. Was this normal cat behavior? Mr. Dursley wondered. Trying to pull himself together, he let himself into the house. He was still determined not to 
mention anything to his wife. 
Mrs. Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over dinner all about Mrs. Next Door’s problems with her daughter and how 
Dudley had learned a new word (“Won’t!”). Mr. Dursley tried to 
act normally. When Dudley had been put to bed, he went into the 
living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news: 
“And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the 
nation’s owls have been behaving very unusually today. Although 
owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, 
there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every 
direction since sunrise. Experts are unable to explain why the owls 
have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern.” The newscaster allowed himself a grin. “Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim 
McGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more showers of owls 
tonight, Jim?” 
“Well, Ted,” said the weatherman, “I don’t know about that, but 
it’s not only the owls that have been acting oddly today. Viewers as 
far apart as Kent, Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to 
tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday, they’ve had a 
downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps people have been celebrating 
Bonfire Night early — it’s not until next week, folks! But I can 
promise a wet night tonight.” 
Mr. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all over 
Britain? Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious people in cloaks all 
over the place? And a whisper, a whisper about the Potters . . . 
THE BOY WHO LIVED 
 7 
Mrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of 
tea. It was no good. He’d have to say something to her. He cleared 
his throat nervously. “Er — Petunia, dear — you haven’t heard from 
your sister lately, have you?” 
As he had expected, Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and angry. After all, they normally pretended she didn’t have a sister. 
“No,” she said sharply. “Why?” 
“Funny stuff on the news,” Mr. Dursley mumbled. “Owls . . . 
shooting stars . . . and there were a lot of funny-looking people in 
town today . . .” 
“So?” snapped Mrs. Dursley. 
“Well, I just thought . . . maybe . . . it was something to do 
with . . . you know . . . her crowd.” 
Mrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr. Dursley 
wondered whether he dared tell her he’d heard the name “Potter.” 
He decided he didn’t dare. Instead he said, as casually as he could, 
“Their son — he’d be about Dudley’s age now, wouldn’t he?” 
“I suppose so,” said Mrs. Dursley stiffly. 
“What’s his name again? Howard, isn’t it?” 
“Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.” 
“Oh, yes,” said Mr. Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. “Yes, I 
quite agree.” 
He didn’t say another word on the subject as they went upstairs 
to bed. While Mrs. Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr. Dursley 
crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden. The cat was still there. It was staring down Privet Drive as 
though it were waiting for something. 
Was he imagining things? Could all this have anything to do 
CHAPTER ONE 
 8 
with the Potters? If it did . . . if it got out that they were related to 
a pair of — well, he didn’t think he could bear it. 
The Dursleys got into bed. Mrs. Dursley fell asleep quickly but 
Mr. Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His last, 
comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters 
were involved, there was no reason for them to come near him and 
Mrs. Dursley. The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia 
thought about them and their kind. . . . He couldn’t see how he 
and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going 
on — he yawned and turned over — it couldn’t affect them. . . . 
How very wrong he was. 
Mr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but 
the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It was 
sitting as still as a statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive. It didn’t so much as quiver when a car door 
slammed on the next street, nor when two owls swooped overhead. 
In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all. 
A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so suddenly and silently you’d have thought he’d just 
popped out of the ground. The cat’s tail twitched and its eyes narrowed. 
Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive. He 
was tall, thin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and 
beard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt. He was 
wearing long robes, a purple cloak that swept the ground, and 
high-heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were light, bright, and 
sparkling behind half-moon spectacles and his nose was very long 
and crooked, as though it had been broken at least twice. This 
man’s name was Albus Dumbledore. 
THE BOY WHO LIVED 
 9 
Albus Dumbledore didn’t seem to realize that he had just arrived 
in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome. He was busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But he did seem to realize he was being watched, because he 
looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still staring at him from 
the other end of the street. For some reason, the sight of the cat 
seemed to amuse him. He chuckled and muttered, “I should have 
known.” 
He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. It 
seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter. He flicked it open, held it up 
in the air, and clicked it. The nearest street lamp went out with a 
little pop. He clicked it again — the next lamp flickered into darkness. Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer, until the only lights 
left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance, 
which were the eyes of the cat watching him. If anyone looked out 
of their window now, even beady-eyed Mrs. Dursley, they wouldn’t 
be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement. 
Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back inside his cloak and set 
off down the street toward number four, where he sat down on the 
wall next to the cat. He didn’t look at it, but after a moment he 
spoke to it. 
“Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.” 
He turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he was 
smiling at a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square 
glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its 
eyes. She, too, was wearing a cloak, an emerald one. Her black hair 
was drawn into a tight bun. She looked distinctly ruffled. 
“How did you know it was me?” she asked. 
“My dear Professor, I’ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly.” 
CHAPTER ONE 
 10 
“You’d be stiff if you’d been sitting on a brick wall all day,” said 
Professor McGonagall. 
“All day? When you could have been celebrating? I must have 
passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here.” 
Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily. 
“Oh yes, everyone’s celebrating, all right,” she said impatiently. 
“You’d think they’d be a bit more careful, but no — even the Muggles have noticed something’s going on. It was on their news.” She 
jerked her head back at the Dursleys’ dark living-room window. “I 
heard it. Flocks of owls . . . shooting stars. . . . Well, they’re not 
completely stupid. They were bound to notice something. Shooting stars down in Kent — I’ll bet that was Dedalus Diggle. He 
never had much sense.” 
“You can’t blame them,” said Dumbledore gently. “We’ve had 
precious little to celebrate for eleven years.” 
“I know that,” said Professor McGonagall irritably. “But that’s 
no reason to lose our heads. People are being downright careless, 
out on the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle 
clothes, swapping rumors.” 
She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as 
though hoping he was going to tell her something, but he didn’t, so 
she went on. “A fine thing it would be if, on the very day YouKnow-Who seems to have disappeared at last, the Muggles found 
out about us all. I suppose he really has gone, Dumbledore?” 
“It certainly seems so,” said Dumbledore. “We have much to be 
thankful for. Would you care for a lemon drop?” 
“A what?” 
“A lemon drop. They’re a kind of Muggle sweet I’m rather 
fond of.” 
THE BOY WHO LIVED 
 11 
“No, thank you,” said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though 
she didn’t think this was the moment for lemon drops. “As I say, 
even if You-Know-Who has gone —” 
“My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can call 
him by his name? All this ‘You-Know-Who’ nonsense — for eleven 
years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his 
proper name: Voldemort.” Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to notice. “It all gets so confusing if we keep saying ‘You-Know-Who.’ I 
have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort’s 
name.” 
“I know you haven’t,” said Professor McGonagall, sounding half 
exasperated, half admiring. “But you’re different. Everyone knows 
you’re the only one You-Know- oh, all right, Voldemort, was frightened of.” 
“You flatter me,” said Dumbledore calmly. “Voldemort had 
powers I will never have.” 
“Only because you’re too — well — noble to use them.” 
“It’s lucky it’s dark. I haven’t blushed so much since Madam 
Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs.” 
Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and 
said, “The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying 
around. You know what everyone’s saying? About why he’s disappeared? About what finally stopped him?” 
It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she 
was most anxious to discuss, the real reason she had been waiting 
on a cold, hard wall all day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had 
she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now. It 
was plain that whatever “everyone” was saying, she was not going 
CHAPTER ONE 
 12 
to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true. Dumbledore, 
however, was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer. 
“What they’re saying,” she pressed on, “is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric’s Hollow. He went to find the Potters. The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are — are — that 
they’re — dead.” 
Dumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagall gasped. 
“Lily and James . . . I can’t believe it . . . I didn’t want to believe 
it . . . Oh, Albus . . .” 
Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder. “I 
know . . . I know . . .” he said heavily. 
Professor McGonagall’s voice trembled as she went on. “That’s 
not all. They’re saying he tried to kill the Potters’ son, Harry. 
But — he couldn’t. He couldn’t kill that little boy. No one knows 
why, or how, but they’re saying that when he couldn’t kill Harry 
Potter, Voldemort’s power somehow broke — and that’s why he’s 
gone.” 
Dumbledore nodded glumly. 
“It’s — it’s true?” faltered Professor McGonagall. “After all he’s 
done . . . all the people he’s killed . . . he couldn’t kill a little boy? 
It’s just astounding . . . of all the things to stop him . . . but how in 
the name of heaven did Harry survive?” 
“We can only guess,” said Dumbledore. “We may never know.” 
Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and 
dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles. Dumbledore gave a great 
sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it. It 
was a very odd watch. It had twelve hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving around the edge. It must have 
THE BOY WHO LIVED 
 13 
made sense to Dumbledore, though, because he put it back in his 
pocket and said, “Hagrid’s late. I suppose it was he who told you I’d 
be here, by the way?” 
“Yes,” said Professor McGonagall. “And I don’t suppose you’re 
going to tell me why you’re here, of all places?” 
“I’ve come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. They’re the 
only family he has left now.” 
“You don’t mean — you can’t mean the people who live here?” 
cried Professor McGonagall, jumping to her feet and pointing at 
number four. “Dumbledore — you can’t. I’ve been watching them 
all day. You couldn’t find two people who are less like us. And 
they’ve got this son — I saw him kicking his mother all the way up 
the street, screaming for sweets. Harry Potter come and live here!” 
“It’s the best place for him,” said Dumbledore firmly. “His aunt 
and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he’s older. 
I’ve written them a letter.” 
“A letter?” repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting back 
down on the wall. “Really, Dumbledore, you think you can explain 
all this in a letter? These people will never understand him! He’ll be 
famous — a legend — I wouldn’t be surprised if today was known 
as Harry Potter Day in the future — there will be books written 
about Harry — every child in our world will know his name!” 
“Exactly,” said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top 
of his half-moon glasses. “It would be enough to turn any boy’s 
head. Famous before he can walk and talk! Famous for something 
he won’t even remember! Can’t you see how much better off he’ll 
be, growing up away from all that until he’s ready to take it?” 
Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her mind, 
CHAPTER ONE 
 14 
swallowed, and then said, “Yes — yes, you’re right, of course. But 
how is the boy getting here, Dumbledore?” She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath 
it. 
“Hagrid’s bringing him.” 
“You think it — wise — to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?” 
“I would trust Hagrid with my life,” said Dumbledore. 
“I’m not saying his heart isn’t in the right place,” said Professor 
McGonagall grudgingly, “but you can’t pretend he’s not careless. 
He does tend to — what was that?” 
A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them. It 
grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for 
some sign of a headlight; it swelled to a roar as they both looked up 
at the sky — and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed 
on the road in front of them. 
If the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting 
astride it. He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least 
five times as wide. He looked simply too big to be allowed, and so 
wild — long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his 
face, he had hands the size of trash can lids, and his feet in their 
leather boots were like baby dolphins. In his vast, muscular arms he 
was holding a bundle of blankets. 
“Hagrid,” said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. “At last. And 
where did you get that motorcycle?” 
“Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir,” said the giant, climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke. “Young Sirius Black 
lent it to me. I’ve got him, sir.” 
THE BOY WHO LIVED 
 15 
“No problems, were there?” 
“No, sir — house was almost destroyed, but I got him out all 
right before the Muggles started swarmin’ around. He fell asleep as 
we was flyin’ over Bristol.” 
Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the 
bundle of blankets. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep. 
Under a tuft of jet-black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut, like a bolt of lightning. 
“Is that where — ?” whispered Professor McGonagall. 
“Yes,” said Dumbledore. “He’ll have that scar forever.” 
“Couldn’t you do something about it, Dumbledore?” 
“Even if I could, I wouldn’t. Scars can come in handy. I have one 
myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground. Well — give him here, Hagrid — we’d better get this 
over with.” 
Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the 
Dursleys’ house. 
“Could I — could I say good-bye to him, sir?” asked Hagrid. He 
bent his great, shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must 
have been a very scratchy, whiskery kiss. Then, suddenly, Hagrid 
let out a howl like a wounded dog. 
“Shhh!” hissed Professor McGonagall, “you’ll wake the Muggles!” 
“S-s-sorry,” sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large, spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it. “But I c-c-can’t stand it — Lily an’ 
James dead — an’ poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles —” 
“Yes, yes, it’s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or 
we’ll be found,” Professor McGonagall whispered, patting Hagrid 
CHAPTER ONE 
 16 
gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden 
wall and walked to the front door. He laid Harry gently on the 
doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked it inside Harry’s 
blankets, and then came back to the other two. For a full minute 
the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle; Hagrid’s 
shoulders shook, Professor McGonagall blinked furiously, and the 
twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore’s eyes seemed 
to have gone out. 
“Well,” said Dumbledore finally, “that’s that. We’ve no business 
staying here. We may as well go and join the celebrations.” 
“Yeah,” said Hagrid in a very muffled voice, “I’d best get this 
bike away. G’night, Professor McGonagall — Professor Dumbledore, sir.” 
Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid swung 
himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life; with a 
roar it rose into the air and off into the night. 
“I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,” said 
Dumbledore, nodding to her. Professor McGonagall blew her nose 
in reply. 
Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street. On the 
corner he stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer. He clicked it 
once, and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so 
that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a 
tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street. 
He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number 
four. 
“Good luck, Harry,” he murmured. He turned on his heel and 
with a swish of his cloak, he was gone. 
THE BOY WHO LIVED

A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay silent 
and tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you would expect 
astonishing things to happen. Harry Potter rolled over inside his 
blankets without waking up. One small hand closed on the letter 
beside him and he slept on, not knowing he was special, not knowing he was famous, not knowing he would be woken in a few 
hours’ time by Mrs. Dursley’s scream as she opened the front door 
to put out the milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next few 
weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley. . . . He 
couldn’t know that at this very moment, people meeting in secret 
all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in 
hushed voices: “To Harry Potter — the boy who lived!”

THE VANISHING GLASS 
early ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken 
up to find their nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive 
had hardly changed at all. The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the Dursleys’ front door; 
it crept into their living room, which was almost exactly the same 
as it had been on the night when Mr. Dursley had seen that fateful 
news report about the owls. Only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed. Ten years ago, 
there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink 
beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets — but Dudley Dursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large 
blond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing 
a computer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his 
mother. The room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the 
house, too.

Yet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not 
for long. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice 
that made the first noise of the day. 
“Up! Get up! Now!” 
Harry woke with a start. His aunt rapped on the door again. 
“Up!” she screeched. Harry heard her walking toward the 
kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the 
stove. He rolled onto his back and tried to remember the dream he 
had been having. It had been a good one. There had been a flying 
motorcycle in it. He had a funny feeling he’d had the same dream 
before. 
His aunt was back outside the door. 
“Are you up yet?” she demanded. 
“Nearly,” said Harry. 
“Well, get a move on, I want you to look after the bacon. And 
don’t you dare let it burn, I want everything perfect on Duddy’s 
birthday.” 
Harry groaned. 
“What did you say?” his aunt snapped through the door. 
“Nothing, nothing . . .” 
Dudley’s birthday — how could he have forgotten? Harry got 
slowly out of bed and started looking for socks. He found a pair 
under his bed and, after pulling a spider off one of them, put them 
on. Harry was used to spiders, because the cupboard under the 
stairs was full of them, and that was where he slept. 
When he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen. 
The table was almost hidden beneath all Dudley’s birthday presents. It looked as though Dudley had gotten the new computer he 
CHAPTER TWO 
 20 
wanted, not to mention the second television and the racing bike. 
Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to Harry, 
as Dudley was very fat and hated exercise — unless of course it involved punching somebody. Dudley’s favorite punching bag was 
Harry, but he couldn’t often catch him. Harry didn’t look it, but he 
was very fast. 
Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, 
but Harry had always been small and skinny for his age. He looked 
even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to 
wear were old clothes of Dudley’s, and Dudley was about four 
times bigger than he was. Harry had a thin face, knobbly knees, 
black hair, and bright green eyes. He wore round glasses held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley had 
punched him on the nose. The only thing Harry liked about his 
own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was 
shaped like a bolt of lightning. He had had it as long as he could remember, and the first question he could ever remember asking his 
Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it. 
“In the car crash when your parents died,” she had said. “And 
don’t ask questions.” 
Don’t ask questions — that was the first rule for a quiet life with 
the Dursleys. 
Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the 
bacon. 
“Comb your hair!” he barked, by way of a morning greeting. 
About once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his 
newspaper and shouted that Harry needed a haircut. Harry must 
have had more haircuts than the rest of the boys in his class put 
The Vanishing Glass 
 21 
together, but it made no difference, his hair simply grew that 
way — all over the place. 
Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen 
with his mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a 
large pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick 
blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia 
often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel — Harry often said 
that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig. 
Harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, which was 
difficult as there wasn’t much room. Dudley, meanwhile, was 
counting his presents. His face fell. 
“Thirty-six,” he said, looking up at his mother and father. 
“That’s two less than last year.” 
“Darling, you haven’t counted Auntie Marge’s present, see, it’s 
here under this big one from Mommy and Daddy.” 
“All right, thirty-seven then,” said Dudley, going red in the face. 
Harry, who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on, began 
wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley turned 
the table over. 
Aunt Petunia obviously scented danger, too, because she said 
quickly, “And we’ll buy you another two presents while we’re out 
today. How’s that, popkin? Two more presents. Is that all right?” 
Dudley thought for a moment. It looked like hard work. Finally 
he said slowly, “So I’ll have thirty . . . thirty . . .” 
“Thirty-nine, sweetums,” said Aunt Petunia. 
“Oh.” Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel. 
“All right then.” 
Uncle Vernon chuckled. 
CHAPTER TWO 
 22 
“Little tyke wants his money’s worth, just like his father. ’Atta 
boy, Dudley!” He ruffled Dudley’s hair. 
At that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to 
answer it while Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap 
the racing bike, a video camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen 
new computer games, and a VCR. He was ripping the paper off a 
gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia came back from the telephone 
looking both angry and worried. 
“Bad news, Vernon,” she said. “Mrs. Figg’s broken her leg. She 
can’t take him.” She jerked her head in Harry’s direction. 
Dudley’s mouth fell open in horror, but Harry’s heart gave a 
leap. Every year on Dudley’s birthday, his parents took him and a 
friend out for the day, to adventure parks, hamburger restaurants, 
or the movies. Every year, Harry was left behind with Mrs. Figg, a 
mad old lady who lived two streets away. Harry hated it there. The 
whole house smelled of cabbage and Mrs. Figg made him look at 
photographs of all the cats she’d ever owned. 
“Now what?” said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at Harry as 
though he’d planned this. Harry knew he ought to feel sorry that 
Mrs. Figg had broken her leg, but it wasn’t easy when he reminded 
himself it would be a whole year before he had to look at Tibbies, 
Snowy, Mr. Paws, and Tufty again. 
“We could phone Marge,” Uncle Vernon suggested. 
“Don’t be silly, Vernon, she hates the boy.” 
The Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as though he 
wasn’t there — or rather, as though he was something very nasty 
that couldn’t understand them, like a slug. 
“What about what’s-her-name, your friend — Yvonne?” 
The Vanishing Glass 
 23 
“On vacation in Majorca,” snapped Aunt Petunia. 
“You could just leave me here,” Harry put in hopefully (he’d be 
able to watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe 
even have a go on Dudley’s computer). 
Aunt Petunia looked as though she’d just swallowed a lemon. 
“And come back and find the house in ruins?” she snarled. 
“I won’t blow up the house,” said Harry, but they weren’t listening. 
“I suppose we could take him to the zoo,” said Aunt Petunia 
slowly, “. . . and leave him in the car. . . .” 
“That cars new, he’s not sitting in it alone. . . .” 
Dudley began to cry loudly. In fact, he wasn’t really crying — it 
had been years since he’d really cried — but he knew that if he 
screwed up his face and wailed, his mother would give him anything he wanted. 
“Dinky Duddydums, don’t cry, Mummy won’t let him spoil 
your special day!” she cried, flinging her arms around him. 
“I . . . don’t . . . want . . . him . . . t-t-to come!” Dudley yelled 
between huge, pretend sobs. “He always sp-spoils everything!” He 
shot Harry a nasty grin through the gap in his mothers arms. 
Just then, the doorbell rang — “Oh, good Lord, they’re here!” 
said Aunt Petunia frantically — and a moment later, Dudley’s best 
friend, Piers Polkiss, walked in with his mother. Piers was a 
scrawny boy with a face like a rat. He was usually the one who held 
people’s arms behind their backs while Dudley hit them. Dudley 
stopped pretending to cry at once. 
Half an hour later, Harry, who couldn’t believe his luck, was sitting in the back of the Dursleys’ car with Piers and Dudley, on the 
CHAPTER TWO 
 24 
way to the zoo for the first time in his life. His aunt and uncle 
hadn’t been able to think of anything else to do with him, but before they’d left, Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside. 
“I’m warning you,” he had said, putting his large purple face 
right up close to Harry’s, “I’m warning you now, boy — any funny 
business, anything at all — and you’ll be in that cupboard from 
now until Christmas.” 
I’m not going to do anything,” said Harry, “honestly . . .” 
But Uncle Vernon didn’t believe him. No one ever did. 
The problem was, strange things often happened around Harry 
and it was just no good telling the Dursleys he didn’t make them 
happen. 
Once, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking as though he hadn’t been at all, had taken a pair of 
kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except 
for his bangs, which she left “to hide that horrible scar.” Dudley 
had laughed himself silly at Harry, who spent a sleepless night 
imagining school the next day, where he was already laughed at for 
his baggy clothes and taped glasses. Next morning, however, he had 
gotten up to find his hair exactly as it had been before Aunt Petunia had sheared it off. He had been given a week in his cupboard 
for this, even though he had tried to explain that he couldn’t explain 
how it had grown back so quickly. 
Another time, Aunt Petunia had been trying to force him into a 
revolting old sweater of Dudley’s (brown with orange puff balls). 
The harder she tried to pull it over his head, the smaller it seemed 
to become, until finally it might have fitted a hand puppet, but 
certainly wouldn’t fit Harry. Aunt Petunia had decided it must 
The Vanishing Glass 
 25 
have shrunk in the wash and, to his great relief, Harry wasn’t punished. 
On the other hand, he’d gotten into terrible trouble for being 
found on the roof of the school kitchens. Dudley’s gang had been 
chasing him as usual when, as much to Harry’s surprise as anyone 
else’s, there he was sitting on the chimney. The Dursleys had received a very angry letter from Harry’s headmistress telling them 
Harry had been climbing school buildings. But all he’d tried to do 
(as he shouted at Uncle Vernon through the locked door of his cupboard) was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen 
doors. Harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in 
mid-jump. 
But today, nothing was going to go wrong. It was even worth being with Dudley and Piers to be spending the day somewhere that 
wasn’t school, his cupboard, or Mrs. Figg’s cabbage-smelling living 
room. 
While he drove, Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt Petunia. He 
liked to complain about things: people at work, Harry, the council, 
Harry, the bank, and Harry were just a few of his favorite subjects. 
This morning, it was motorcycles. 
“. . . roaring along like maniacs, the young hoodlums,” he said, 
as a motorcycle overtook them. 
“I had a dream about a motorcycle,” said Harry, remembering 
suddenly. “It was flying.” 
Uncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front. He turned 
right around in his seat and yelled at Harry, his face like a gigantic 
beet with a mustache: “MOTORCYCLES DON’T FLY!” 
Dudley and Piers sniggered. 
CHAPTER TWO 
 26 
“I know they don’t,” said Harry. “It was only a dream.” 
But he wished he hadn’t said anything. If there was one thing the 
Dursleys hated even more than his asking questions, it was his talking about anything acting in a way it shouldn’t, no matter if it was 
in a dream or even a cartoon — they seemed to think he might get 
dangerous ideas. 
It was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was crowded with families. The Dursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice 
creams at the entrance and then, because the smiling lady in the 
van had asked Harry what he wanted before they could hurry him 
away, they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop. It wasn’t bad, either, 
Harry thought, licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its 
head who looked remarkably like Dudley, except that it wasn’t 
blond. 
Harry had the best morning he’d had in a long time. He was 
careful to walk a little way apart from the Dursleys so that Dudley 
and Piers, who were starting to get bored with the animals by 
lunchtime, wouldn’t fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting 
him. They ate in the zoo restaurant, and when Dudley had a 
tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn’t have enough ice 
cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought him another one and Harry 
was allowed to finish the first. 
Harry felt, afterward, that he should have known it was all too 
good to last. 
After lunch they went to the reptile house. It was cool and dark 
in there, with lit windows all along the walls. Behind the glass, all 
sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of 
wood and stone. Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, poisonous 
The Vanishing Glass 
 27 
cobras and thick, man-crushing pythons. Dudley quickly found 
the largest snake in the place. It could have wrapped its body twice 
around Uncle Vernon’s car and crushed it into a trash can — but at 
the moment it didn’t look in the mood. In fact, it was fast asleep. 
Dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at 
the glistening brown coils. 
“Make it move,” he whined at his father. Uncle Vernon tapped 
on the glass, but the snake didn’t budge. 
“Do it again,” Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped the glass 
smartly with his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on. 
“This is boring,” Dudley moaned. He shuffled away. 
Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the 
snake. He wouldn’t have been surprised if it had died of boredom 
itself — no company except stupid people drumming their fingers 
on the glass trying to disturb it all day long. It was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake you up; at least he got to visit 
the rest of the house. 
The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it 
raised its head until its eyes were on a level with Harry’s. 
It winked.
Harry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone 
was watching. They weren’t. He looked back at the snake and 
winked, too. 
The snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, 
then raised its eyes to the ceiling. It gave Harry a look that said 
quite plainly: 
“I get that all the time.” 
CHAPTER TWO 
 28 
“I know,” Harry murmured through the glass, though he wasn’t 
sure the snake could hear him. “It must be really annoying.” 
The snake nodded vigorously. 
“Where do you come from, anyway?” Harry asked. 
The snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass. Harry 
peered at it. 
Boa Constrictor, Brazil. 
“Was it nice there?” 
The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry 
read on: This specimen was bred in the zoo. “Oh, I see — so you’ve 
never been to Brazil?” 
As the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry 
made both of them jump. “DUDLEY! MR. DURSLEY! COME 
AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE! YOU WON’T BELIEVE 
WHAT IT’S DOING!” 
Dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could. 
“Out of the way, you,” he said, punching Harry in the ribs. 
Caught by surprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor. What 
came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened — one 
second, Piers and Dudley were leaning right up close to the glass, 
the next, they had leapt back with howls of horror. 
Harry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor’s 
tank had vanished. The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, 
slithering out onto the floor. People throughout the reptile house 
screamed and started running for the exits. 
As the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn a low, 
hissing voice said, “Brazil, here I come. . . . Thanksss, amigo.” 
The keeper of the reptile house was in shock. 
The Vanishing Glass 
 29 
“But the glass,” he kept saying, “where did the glass go?” 
The zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong, 
sweet tea while he apologized over and over again. Piers and Dudley could only gibber. As far as Harry had seen, the snake hadn’t 
done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but 
by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon’s car, Dudley was 
telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was 
swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death. But worst of all, for 
Harry at least, was Piers calming down enough to say, “Harry was 
talking to it, weren’t you, Harry?” 
Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before starting on Harry. He was so angry he could hardly speak. He 
managed to say, “Go — cupboard — stay — no meals,” before he 
collapsed into a chair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a 
large brandy. 
Harry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing he had a watch. 
He didn’t know what time it was and he couldn’t be sure the Dursleys were asleep yet. Until they were, he couldn’t risk sneaking to 
the kitchen for some food. 
He’d lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten miserable 
years, as long as he could remember, ever since he’d been a baby 
and his parents had died in that car crash. He couldn’t remember 
being in the car when his parents had died. Sometimes, when he 
strained his memory during long hours in his cupboard, he came 
up with a strange vision: a blinding flash of green light and a burning pain on his forehead. This, he supposed, was the crash, though 
he couldn’t imagine where all the green light came from. He 
CHAPTER TWO 
 30 
couldn’t remember his parents at all. His aunt and uncle never 
spoke about them, and of course he was forbidden to ask questions. 
There were no photographs of them in the house. 
When he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and dreamed of 
some unknown relation coming to take him away, but it had never 
happened; the Dursleys were his only family. Yet sometimes he 
thought (or maybe hoped) that strangers in the street seemed to 
know him. Very strange strangers they were, too. A tiny man in a 
violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with 
Aunt Petunia and Dudley. After asking Harry furiously if he knew 
the man, Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of the shop without 
buying anything. A wild-looking old woman dressed all in green 
had waved merrily at him once on a bus. A bald man in a very long 
purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day 
and then walked away without a word. The weirdest thing about all 
these people was the way they seemed to vanish the second Harry 
tried to get a closer look. 
At school, Harry had no one. Everybody knew that Dudley’s 
gang hated that odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with Dudley’s gang. 
C H A P T E R T H R E E

THE LETTERS

he escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned Harry his 
longest-ever punishment. By the time he was allowed out of 
his cupboard again, the summer holidays had started and Dudley 
had already broken his new video camera, crashed his remote control airplane, and, first time out on his racing bike, knocked down 
old Mrs. Figg as she crossed Privet Drive on her crutches. 
Harry was glad school was over, but there was no escaping Dudley’s gang, who visited the house every single day. Piers, Dennis, 
Malcolm, and Gordon were all big and stupid, but as Dudley was 
the biggest and stupidest of the lot, he was the leader. The rest of 
them were all quite happy to join in Dudley’s favorite sport: Harry 
Hunting. 
This was why Harry spent as much time as possible out of the 
house, wandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays, where he could see a tiny ray of hope. When September came 
he would be going off to secondary school and, for the first time in 
T 
CHAPTER THREE 
 32 
his life, he wouldn’t be with Dudley. Dudley had been accepted at 
Uncle Vernon’s old private school, Smeltings. Piers Polkiss was going there too. Harry, on the other hand, was going to Stonewall 
High, the local public school. Dudley thought this was very funny. 
“They stuff people’s heads down the toilet the first day at 
Stonewall,” he told Harry. “Want to come upstairs and practice?” 
“No, thanks,” said Harry. “The poor toilet’s never had anything 
as horrible as your head down it — it might be sick.” Then he ran, 
before Dudley could work out what he’d said. 
One day in July, Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London to buy 
his Smeltings uniform, leaving Harry at Mrs. Figg’s. Mrs. Figg 
wasn’t as bad as usual. It turned out she’d broken her leg tripping 
over one of her cats, and she didn’t seem quite as fond of them as 
before. She let Harry watch television and gave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though she’d had it for several years. 
That evening, Dudley paraded around the living room for the 
family in his brand-new uniform. Smeltings boys wore maroon 
tailcoats, orange knickerbockers, and flat straw hats called boaters. 
They also carried knobbly sticks, used for hitting each other while 
the teachers weren’t looking. This was supposed to be good training for later life. 
As he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers, Uncle Vernon said gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life. Aunt 
Petunia burst into tears and said she couldn’t believe it was her Ickle 
Dudleykins, he looked so handsome and grown-up. Harry didn’t 
trust himself to speak. He thought two of his ribs might already 
have cracked from trying not to laugh. 
  
THE LETTERS

 33 
There was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when 
Harry went in for breakfast. It seemed to be coming from a large 
metal tub in the sink. He went to have a look. The tub was full of 
what looked like dirty rags swimming in gray water. 
“What’s this?” he asked Aunt Petunia. Her lips tightened as they 
always did if he dared to ask a question. 
“Your new school uniform,” she said. 
Harry looked in the bowl again. 
“Oh,” he said, “I didn’t realize it had to be so wet.” 
“Don’t be stupid,” snapped Aunt Petunia. “I’m dyeing some of 
Dudley’s old things gray for you. It’ll look just like everyone else’s 
when I’ve finished.” 
Harry seriously doubted this, but thought it best not to argue. 
He sat down at the table and tried not to think about how he was 
going to look on his first day at Stonewall High — like he was 
wearing bits of old elephant skin, probably. 
Dudley and Uncle Vernon came in, both with wrinkled noses 
because of the smell from Harry’s new uniform. Uncle Vernon 
opened his newspaper as usual and Dudley banged his Smelting 
stick, which he carried everywhere, on the table. 
They heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the 
doormat. 
“Get the mail, Dudley,” said Uncle Vernon from behind his paper. 
“Make Harry get it.” 
“Get the mail, Harry.” 
“Make Dudley get it.” 
“Poke him with your Smelting stick, Dudley.” 
CHAPTER THREE 
 34 
Harry dodged the Smelting stick and went to get the mail. Three 
things lay on the doormat: a postcard from Uncle Vernon’s sister 
Marge, who was vacationing on the Isle of Wight, a brown envelope that looked like a bill, and — a letter for Harry.
Harry picked it up and stared at it, his heart twanging like a giant elastic band. No one, ever, in his whole life, had written to him. 
Who would? He had no friends, no other relatives — he didn’t belong to the library, so he’d never even got rude notes asking for 
books back. Yet here it was, a letter, addressed so plainly there 
could be no mistake: 
Mr. H. Potter 
The Cupboard under the Stairs 
4 Privet Drive 
Little Whinging 
Surrey 
The envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish parchment, 
and the address was written in emerald-green ink. There was no 
stamp. 
Turning the envelope over, his hand trembling, Harry saw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms; a lion, an eagle, a badger, and a 
snake surrounding a large letter H.
“Hurry up, boy!” shouted Uncle Vernon from the kitchen. 
“What are you doing, checking for letter bombs?” He chuckled at 
his own joke. 
Harry went back to the kitchen, still staring at his letter. He 
handed Uncle Vernon the bill and the postcard, sat down, and 
slowly began to open the yellow envelope. 
THE LETTERS 
FROM NO ONE 
 35 
Uncle Vernon ripped open the bill, snorted in disgust, and 
flipped over the postcard. 
“Marge’s ill,” he informed Aunt Petunia. “Ate a funny 
whelk . . .” 
“Dad!” said Dudley suddenly. “Dad, Harry’s got something!” 
Harry was on the point of unfolding his letter, which was written on the same heavy parchment as the envelope, when it was 
jerked sharply out of his hand by Uncle Vernon. 
“That’s mine!” said Harry, trying to snatch it back. 
“Who’d be writing to you?” sneered Uncle Vernon, shaking the 
letter open with one hand and glancing at it. His face went from 
red to green faster than a set of traffic lights. And it didn’t stop 
there. Within seconds it was the grayish white of old porridge. 
“P-P-Petunia!” he gasped. 
Dudley tried to grab the letter to read it, but Uncle Vernon held 
it high out of his reach. Aunt Petunia took it curiously and read the 
first line. For a moment it looked as though she might faint. She 
clutched her throat and made a choking noise. 
“Vernon! Oh my goodness — Vernon!” 
They stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten that Harry 
and Dudley were still in the room. Dudley wasn’t used to being ignored. He gave his father a sharp tap on the head with his Smelting 
stick. 
“I want to read that letter,” he said loudly. 
“I want to read it,” said Harry furiously, “as it’s mine.” 
“Get out, both of you,” croaked Uncle Vernon, stuffing the letter back inside its envelope. 
Harry didn’t move. 
“I WANT MY LETTER!” he shouted. 
CHAPTER THREE 
 36 
“Let me see it!” demanded Dudley. 
“OUT!” roared Uncle Vernon, and he took both Harry and 
Dudley by the scruffs of their necks and threw them into the 
hall, slamming the kitchen door behind them. Harry and Dudley 
promptly had a furious but silent fight over who would listen at 
the keyhole; Dudley won, so Harry, his glasses dangling from one 
ear, lay flat on his stomach to listen at the crack between door and 
floor. 
“Vernon,” Aunt Petunia was saying in a quivering voice, “look at 
the address — how could they possibly know where he sleeps? You 
don’t think they’re watching the house?” 
“Watching — spying — might be following us,” muttered Uncle Vernon wildly. 
“But what should we do, Vernon? Should we write back? Tell 
them we don’t want —” 
Harry could see Uncle Vernon’s shiny black shoes pacing up and 
down the kitchen. 
“No,” he said finally. “No, we’ll ignore it. If they don’t get an answer. . . . Yes, that’s best . . . we won’t do anything. . . .” 
“But —” 
“I’m not having one in the house, Petunia! Didn’t we swear when 
we took him in we’d stamp out that dangerous nonsense?” 
That evening when he got back from work, Uncle Vernon did 
something he’d never done before; he visited Harry in his cupboard. 
“Where’s my letter?” said Harry, the moment Uncle Vernon had 
squeezed through the door. “Who’s writing to me?” 
THE LETTERS 
FROM NO ONE 
 37 
“No one. It was addressed to you by mistake,” said Uncle Vernon shortly. “I have burned it.” 
“It was not a mistake,” said Harry angrily, “it had my cupboard 
on it.” 
“SILENCE!” yelled Uncle Vernon, and a couple of spiders fell 
from the ceiling. He took a few deep breaths and then forced his 
face into a smile, which looked quite painful. 
“Er — yes, Harry — about this cupboard. Your aunt and I 
have been thinking . . . you’re really getting a bit big for it . . . we 
think it might be nice if you moved into Dudley’s second bedroom.” 
“Why?” said Harry. 
“Don’t ask questions!” snapped his uncle. “Take this stuff upstairs, now.” 
The Dursleys’ house had four bedrooms: one for Uncle Vernon 
and Aunt Petunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle Vernon’s sister, 
Marge), one where Dudley slept, and one where Dudley kept all 
the toys and things that wouldn’t fit into his first bedroom. It only 
took Harry one trip upstairs to move everything he owned from 
the cupboard to this room. He sat down on the bed and stared 
around him. Nearly everything in here was broken. The month-old 
video camera was lying on top of a small, working tank Dudley had 
once driven over the next door neighbor’s dog; in the corner was 
Dudley’s first-ever television set, which he’d put his foot through 
when his favorite program had been canceled; there was a large 
birdcage, which had once held a parrot that Dudley had swapped 
at school for a real air rifle, which was up on a shelf with the end all 
bent because Dudley had sat on it. Other shelves were full of 
CHAPTER THREE 
 38 
books. They were the only things in the room that looked as 
though they’d never been touched. 
From downstairs came the sound of Dudley bawling at his 
mother, “I don’t want him in there . . . I need that room . . . make 
him get out. . . .” 
Harry sighed and stretched out on the bed. Yesterday he’d have 
given anything to be up here. Today he’d rather be back in his cupboard with that letter than up here without it. 
Next morning at breakfast, everyone was rather quiet. Dudley was 
in shock. He’d screamed, whacked his father with his Smelting 
stick, been sick on purpose, kicked his mother, and thrown his tortoise through the greenhouse roof, and he still didn’t have his room 
back. Harry was thinking about this time yesterday and bitterly 
wishing he’d opened the letter in the hall. Uncle Vernon and Aunt 
Petunia kept looking at each other darkly. 
When the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to be trying 
to be nice to Harry, made Dudley go and get it. They heard him 
banging things with his Smelting stick all the way down the hall. 
Then he shouted, “There’s another one! ‘Mr. H. Potter, The Smallest Bedroom, 4 Privet Drive —’ ” 
With a strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt from his seat and ran 
down the hall, Harry right behind him. Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley to the ground to get the letter from him, which was 
made difficult by the fact that Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon 
around the neck from behind. After a minute of confused fighting, 
in which everyone got hit a lot by the Smelting stick, Uncle Vernon 
straightened up, gasping for breath, with Harry’s letter clutched in 
his hand. 
THE LETTERS 
FROM NO ONE 
 39 
“Go to your cupboard — I mean, your bedroom,” he wheezed 
at Harry. “Dudley — go — just go.” 
Harry walked round and round his new room. Someone knew 
he had moved out of his cupboard and they seemed to know 
he hadn’t received his first letter. Surely that meant they’d try 
again? And this time he’d make sure they didn’t fail. He had a 
plan. 
The repaired alarm clock rang at six o’clock the next morning. 
Harry turned it off quickly and dressed silently He mustn’t wake 
the Dursleys. He stole downstairs without turning on any of the 
lights. 
He was going to wait for the postman on the corner of Privet 
Drive and get the letters for number four first. His heart hammered 
as he crept across the dark hall toward the front door — 
“AAAAARRRGH!” 
Harry leapt into the air; he’d trodden on something big and 
squashy on the doormat — something alive! 
Lights clicked on upstairs and to his horror Harry realized that 
the big, squashy something had been his uncle’s face. Uncle Vernon 
had been lying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag, 
clearly making sure that Harry didn’t do exactly what he’d been trying to do. He shouted at Harry for about half an hour and then 
told him to go and make a cup of tea. Harry shuffled miserably off 
into the kitchen and by the time he got back, the mail had arrived, 
right into Uncle Vernon’s lap. Harry could see three letters addressed in green ink. 
“I want —” he began, but Uncle Vernon was tearing the letters 
into pieces before his eyes. 
CHAPTER THREE 
 40 
Uncle Vernon didn’t go to work that day. He stayed at home and 
nailed up the mail slot. 
“See,” he explained to Aunt Petunia through a mouthful of nails, 
“if they can’t deliver them they’ll just give up.” 
“I’m not sure that’ll work, Vernon.” 
“Oh, these peoples minds work in strange ways, Petunia, they’re 
not like you and me,” said Uncle Vernon, trying to knock in a nail 
with the piece of fruitcake Aunt Petunia had just brought him. 
On Friday, no less than twelve letters arrived for Harry. As they 
couldn’t go through the mail slot they had been pushed under the 
door, slotted through the sides, and a few even forced through the 
small window in the downstairs bathroom. 
Uncle Vernon stayed at home again. After burning all the letters, 
he got out a hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks around 
the front and back doors so no one could go out. He hummed 
“Tiptoe Through the Tulips” as he worked, and jumped at small 
noises. 
On Saturday, things began to get out of hand. Twenty-four letters 
to Harry found their way into the house, rolled up and hidden inside each of the two dozen eggs that their very confused milkman 
had handed Aunt Petunia through the living room window. While 
Uncle Vernon made furious telephone calls to the post office and 
the dairy trying to find someone to complain to, Aunt Petunia 
shredded the letters in her food processor. 
“Who on earth wants to talk to you this badly?” Dudley asked 
Harry in amazement. 
  

On Sunday morning, Uncle Vernon sat down at the breakfast table 
looking tired and rather ill, but happy. 
“No post on Sundays,” he reminded them cheerfully as he 
spread marmalade on his newspapers, “no damn letters today —” 
Something came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as he 
spoke and caught him sharply on the back of the head. Next moment, thirty or forty letters came pelting out of the fireplace like 
bullets. The Dursleys ducked, but Harry leapt into the air trying to 
catch one — 
“Out! OUT!” 
Uncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and threw him into 
the hall. When Aunt Petunia and Dudley had run out with their 
arms over their faces, Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut. They 
could hear the letters still streaming into the room, bouncing off 
the walls and floor. 
“That does it,” said Uncle Vernon, trying to speak calmly but 
pulling great tufts out of his mustache at the same time. “I want 
you all back here in five minutes ready to leave. We’re going away. 
Just pack some clothes. No arguments!” 
He looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no 
one dared argue. Ten minutes later they had wrenched their way 
through the boarded-up doors and were in the car, speeding toward 
the highway. Dudley was sniffling in the back seat; his father had 
hit him round the head for holding them up while he tried to pack 
his television, VCR, and computer in his sports bag. 
They drove. And they drove. Even Aunt Petunia didn’t dare 
ask where they were going. Every now and then Uncle Vernon 
would take a sharp turn and drive in the opposite direction for a 
while. 
CHAPTER THREE 
 42 
“Shake ’em off . . . shake ’em off,” he would mutter whenever he 
did this. 
They didn’t stop to eat or drink all day. By nightfall Dudley was 
howling. He’d never had such a bad day in his life. He was hungry, 
he’d missed five television programs he’d wanted to see, and he’d 
never gone so long without blowing up an alien on his computer. 
Uncle Vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy-looking hotel on 
the outskirts of a big city. Dudley and Harry shared a room with 
twin beds and damp, musty sheets. Dudley snored but Harry 
stayed awake, sitting on the windowsill, staring down at the lights 
of passing cars and wondering. . . . 
They ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for 
breakfast the next day. They had just finished when the owner of 
the hotel came over to their table. 
“ ’Scuse me, but is one of you Mr. H. Potter? Only I got about an 
’undred of these at the front desk.” 
She held up a letter so they could read the green ink address: 
Mr. H. Potter 
Room 17 
Railview Hotel 
Cokeworth 
Harry made a grab for the letter but Uncle Vernon knocked his 
hand out of the way. The woman stared. 
“I’ll take them,” said Uncle Vernon, standing up quickly and following her from the dining room. 
  

 “Wouldn’t it be better just to go home, dear?” Aunt Petunia 
suggested timidly, hours later, but Uncle Vernon didn’t seem to 
hear her. Exactly what he was looking for, none of them knew. He 
drove them into the middle of a forest, got out, looked around, 
shook his head, got back in the car, and off they went again. The 
same thing happened in the middle of a plowed field, halfway 
across a suspension bridge, and at the top of a multilevel parking 
garage. 
“Daddy’s gone mad, hasn’t he?” Dudley asked Aunt Petunia 
dully late that afternoon. Uncle Vernon had parked at the coast, 
locked them all inside the car, and disappeared. 
It started to rain. Great drops beat on the roof of the car. Dudley sniveled. 
“It’s Monday,” he told his mother. “The Great Humberto’s on 
tonight. I want to stay somewhere with a television.” 
Monday. This reminded Harry of something. If it was Monday — and you could usually count on Dudley to know the days of 
the week, because of television — then tomorrow, Tuesday, was 
Harry’s eleventh birthday. Of course, his birthdays were never exactly fun — last year, the Dursleys had given him a coat hanger 
and a pair of Uncle Vernon’s old socks. Still, you weren’t eleven 
every day. 
Uncle Vernon was back and he was smiling. He was also carrying a long, thin package and didn’t answer Aunt Petunia when she 
asked what he’d bought. 
“Found the perfect place!” he said. “Come on! Everyone 
out!” 
It was very cold outside the car. Uncle Vernon was pointing at 
what looked like a large rock way out at sea. Perched on top of the 
CHAPTER THREE 
 44 
rock was the most miserable little shack you could imagine. One 
thing was certain, there was no television in there. 
“Storm forecast for tonight!” said Uncle Vernon gleefully, clapping his hands together. “And this gentleman’s kindly agreed to 
lend us his boat!” 
A toothless old man came ambling up to them, pointing, with a 
rather wicked grin, at an old rowboat bobbing in the iron-gray 
water below them. 
“I’ve already got us some rations,” said Uncle Vernon, “so all 
aboard!” 
It was freezing in the boat. Icy sea spray and rain crept down 
their necks and a chilly wind whipped their faces. After what 
seemed like hours they reached the rock, where Uncle Vernon, slipping and sliding, led the way to the broken-down house. 
The inside was horrible; it smelled strongly of seaweed, the wind 
whistled through the gaps in the wooden walls, and the fireplace 
was damp and empty. There were only two rooms. 
Uncle Vernon’s rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and 
four bananas. He tried to start a fire but the empty chip bags just 
smoked and shriveled up. 
“Could do with some of those letters now, eh?” he said cheerfully. 
He was in a very good mood. Obviously he thought nobody 
stood a chance of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail. 
Harry privately agreed, though the thought didn’t cheer him up 
at all. 
As night fell, the promised storm blew up around them. Spray 
from the high waves splattered the walls of the hut and a fierce 
THE LETTERS 
FROM NO ONE 
 45 
wind rattled the filthy windows. Aunt Petunia found a few moldy 
blankets in the second room and made up a bed for Dudley on the 
moth-eaten sofa. She and Uncle Vernon went off to the lumpy bed 
next door, and Harry was left to find the softest bit of floor he 
could and to curl up under the thinnest, most ragged blanket. 
The storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went 
on. Harry couldn’t sleep. He shivered and turned over, trying to get 
comfortable, his stomach rumbling with hunger. Dudley’s snores 
were drowned by the low rolls of thunder that started near midnight. The lighted dial of Dudley’s watch, which was dangling over 
the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist, told Harry he’d be eleven in ten 
minutes’ time. He lay and watched his birthday tick nearer, wondering if the Dursleys would remember at all, wondering where the 
letter writer was now. 
Five minutes to go. Harry heard something creak outside. He 
hoped the roof wasn’t going to fall in, although he might be 
warmer if it did. Four minutes to go. Maybe the house in Privet 
Drive would be so full of letters when they got back that he’d be 
able to steal one somehow. 
Three minutes to go. Was that the sea, slapping hard on the rock 
like that? And (two minutes to go) what was that funny crunching 
noise? Was the rock crumbling into the sea? 
One minute to go and he’d be eleven. Thirty seconds . . . 
twenty . . . ten . . . nine — maybe he’d wake Dudley up, just to 
annoy him — three . . . two . . . one . . . 
BOOM. 
The whole shack shivered and Harry sat bolt upright, staring at 
the door. Someone was outside, knocking to come in. 
C H A P T E R F O U R 
 46 
THE KEEPER OF THE KEYS 
OOM. They knocked again. Dudley jerked awake. 
“Where’s the cannon?” he said stupidly. 
There was a crash behind them and Uncle Vernon came skidding into the room. He was holding a rifle in his hands — now 
they knew what had been in the long, thin package he had brought 
with them. 
“Who’s there?” he shouted. “I warn you — I’m armed!” 
There was a pause. Then — 
SMASH! 
The door was hit with such force that it swung clean off its 
hinges and with a deafening crash landed flat on the floor. 
A giant of a man was standing in the doorway. His face was almost completely hidden by a long, shaggy mane of hair and a wild, 
tangled beard, but you could make out his eyes, glinting like black 
beetles under all the hair. 
B 
THE KEEPER OF THE KEYS 
 47 
The giant squeezed his way into the hut, stooping so that his 
head just brushed the ceiling. He bent down, picked up the door, 
and fitted it easily back into its frame. The noise of the storm outside dropped a little. He turned to look at them all. 
“Couldn’t make us a cup o’ tea, could yeh? It’s not been an easy 
journey. . . .” 
He strode over to the sofa where Dudley sat frozen with fear. 
“Budge up, yeh great lump,” said the stranger. 
Dudley squeaked and ran to hide behind his mother, who was 
crouching, terrified, behind Uncle Vernon. 
“An’ here’s Harry!” said the giant. 
Harry looked up into the fierce, wild, shadowy face and saw that 
the beetle eyes were crinkled in a smile. 
“Las’ time I saw you, you was only a baby,” said the giant. “Yeh 
look a lot like yer dad, but yeh’ve got yer mom’s eyes.” 
Uncle Vernon made a funny rasping noise. 
“I demand that you leave at once, sir!” he said. “You are breaking and entering!” 
“Ah, shut up, Dursley, yeh great prune,” said the giant; he 
reached over the back of the sofa, jerked the gun out of Uncle Vernon’s hands, bent it into a knot as easily as if it had been made of 
rubber, and threw it into a corner of the room. 
Uncle Vernon made another funny noise, like a mouse being 
trodden on. 
“Anyway — Harry,” said the giant, turning his back on the 
Dursleys, “a very happy birthday to yeh. Got summat fer yeh 
here — I mighta sat on it at some point, but it’ll taste all right.” 
From an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled a slightly 
CHAPTER FOUR 
 48 
squashed box. Harry opened it with trembling fingers. Inside was a 
large, sticky chocolate cake with Happy Birthday Harry written on 
it in green icing. 
Harry looked up at the giant. He meant to say thank you, but 
the words got lost on the way to his mouth, and what he said instead was, “Who are you?” 
The giant chuckled. 
“True, I haven’t introduced meself. Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of 
Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts.” 
He held out an enormous hand and shook Harry’s whole arm. 
“What about that tea then, eh?” he said, rubbing his hands together. “I’d not say no ter summat stronger if yeh’ve got it, mind.” 
His eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled chip bags in 
it and he snorted. He bent down over the fireplace; they couldn’t 
see what he was doing but when he drew back a second later, there 
was a roaring fire there. It filled the whole damp hut with flickering 
light and Harry felt the warmth wash over him as though he’d sunk 
into a hot bath. 
The giant sat back down on the sofa, which sagged under his 
weight, and began taking all sorts of things out of the pockets of his 
coat: a copper kettle, a squashy package of sausages, a poker, a 
teapot, several chipped mugs, and a bottle of some amber liquid 
that he took a swig from before starting to make tea. Soon the hut 
was full of the sound and smell of sizzling sausage. Nobody said a 
thing while the giant was working, but as he slid the first six fat, 
juicy, slightly burnt sausages from the poker, Dudley fidgeted a little. Uncle Vernon said sharply, “Don’t touch anything he gives you, 
Dudley.” 
The giant chuckled darkly. 
THE KEEPER OF THE KEYS 
 49 
“Yer great puddin’ of a son don’ need fattenin’ anymore, Dursley, don’ worry.” 
He passed the sausages to Harry, who was so hungry he had 
never tasted anything so wonderful, but he still couldn’t take his 
eyes off the giant. Finally, as nobody seemed about to explain anything, he said, “I’m sorry, but I still don’t really know who you are.” 
The giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back 
of his hand. 
“Call me Hagrid,” he said, “everyone does. An’ like I told yeh, 
I’m Keeper of Keys at Hogwarts — yeh’ll know all about Hogwarts, o’ course.” 
“Er — no,” said Harry. 
Hagrid looked shocked. 
“Sorry,” Harry said quickly. 
“Sorry?” barked Hagrid, turning to stare at the Dursleys, who 
shrank back into the shadows. “It’s them as should be sorry! I knew 
yeh weren’t gettin’ yer letters but I never thought yeh wouldn’t even 
know abou’ Hogwarts, fer cryin’ out loud! Did yeh never wonder 
where yer parents learned it all?” 
“All what?” asked Harry. 
“ALL WHAT?” Hagrid thundered. “Now wait jus’ one second!” 
He had leapt to his feet. In his anger he seemed to fill the whole 
hut. The Dursleys were cowering against the wall. 
“Do you mean ter tell me,” he growled at the Dursleys, “that this 
boy — this boy! — knows nothin’ abou’ — about ANYTHING?” 
Harry thought this was going a bit far. He had been to school, 
after all, and his marks weren’t bad. 
“I know some things,” he said. “I can, you know, do math and 
stuff.” 
CHAPTER FOUR 
 50 
But Hagrid simply waved his hand and said, “About our world, 
I mean. Your world. My world. Yer parents’ world.” 
“What world?” 
Hagrid looked as if he was about to explode. 
“DURSLEY!” he boomed. 
Uncle Vernon, who had gone very pale, whispered something 
that sounded like “Mimblewimble.” Hagrid stared wildly at Harry. 
“But yeh must know about yer mom and dad,” he said. “I mean, 
they’re famous. You’re famous.” 
“What? My — my mom and dad weren’t famous, were they?” 
“Yeh don’ know . . . yeh don’ know . . .” Hagrid ran his fingers 
through his hair, fixing Harry with a bewildered stare. 
“Yeh don’ know what yeh are?” he said finally. 
Uncle Vernon suddenly found his voice. 
“Stop!” he commanded. “Stop right there, sir! I forbid you to tell 
the boy anything!” 
A braver man than Vernon Dursley would have quailed under 
the furious look Hagrid now gave him; when Hagrid spoke, his 
every syllable trembled with rage. 
“You never told him? Never told him what was in the letter 
Dumbledore left fer him? I was there! I saw Dumbledore leave it, 
Dursley! An’ you’ve kept it from him all these years?” 
“Kept what from me?” said Harry eagerly. 
“STOP! I FORBID YOU!” yelled Uncle Vernon in panic. 
Aunt Petunia gave a gasp of horror. 
“Ah, go boil yer heads, both of yeh,” said Hagrid. “Harry — yer 
a wizard.” 
There was silence inside the hut. Only the sea and the whistling 
wind could be heard. 
THE KEEPER OF THE KEYS 
 51 
“I’m a what?” gasped Harry. 
“A wizard, o’ course,” said Hagrid, sitting back down on the 
sofa, which groaned and sank even lower, “an’ a thumpin’ good’un, 
I’d say, once yeh’ve been trained up a bit. With a mum an’ dad like 
yours, what else would yeh be? An’ I reckon it’s abou’ time yeh read 
yer letter.” 
Harry stretched out his hand at last to take the yellowish envelope, addressed in emerald green to Mr. H. Potter, The Floor, Huton-the-Rock, The Sea. He pulled out the letter and read: 
HOGWARTS SCHOOL 
of WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY 
Headmaster: Albus Dumbledore
(Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sorc., Chf. Warlock, 
Supreme Mugwump, International Confed. of Wizards) 
Dear Mr. Potter, 
We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted 
at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please 
find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment. 
Term begins on September 1. We await your owl by no 
later than July 31. 
Yours sincerely, 
Minerva McGonagall, 
Deputy Headmistress
CHAPTER FOUR 
 52 
Questions exploded inside Harry’s head like fireworks and he 
couldn’t decide which to ask first. After a few minutes he stammered, “What does it mean, they await my owl?” 
“Gallopin’ Gorgons, that reminds me,” said Hagrid, clapping a 
hand to his forehead with enough force to knock over a cart horse, 
and from yet another pocket inside his overcoat he pulled an 
owl — a real, live, rather ruffled-looking owl — a long quill, and a 
roll of parchment. With his tongue between his teeth he scribbled 
a note that Harry could read upside down: 
Dear Professor Dumbledore, 
Given Harry his letter. 
Taking him to buy his things tomorrow. 
Weather’s horrible. Hope you’re well. 
Hagrid 
Hagrid rolled up the note, gave it to the owl, which clamped it in 
its beak, went to the door, and threw the owl out into the storm. 
Then he came back and sat down as though this was as normal as 
talking on the telephone. 
Harry realized his mouth was open and closed it quickly. 
“Where was I?” said Hagrid, but at that moment, Uncle Vernon, 
still ashen-faced but looking very angry, moved into the firelight. 
“He’s not going,” he said. 
Hagrid grunted. 
“I’d like ter see a great Muggle like you stop him,” he said. 
“A what?” said Harry, interested. 
THE KEEPER OF THE KEYS 
 53 
“A Muggle,” said Hagrid, “it’s what we call nonmagic folk like 
them. An’ it’s your bad luck you grew up in a family o’ the biggest 
Muggles I ever laid eyes on.” 
“We swore when we took him in we’d put a stop to that rubbish,” said Uncle Vernon, “swore we’d stamp it out of him! Wizard 
indeed!” 
“You knew?” said Harry. “You knew I’m a — a wizard?” 
“Knew!” shrieked Aunt Petunia suddenly. “Knew! Of course we 
knew! How could you not be, my dratted sister being what she 
was? Oh, she got a letter just like that and disappeared off to 
that — that school — and came home every vacation with her 
pockets full of frog spawn, turning teacups into rats. I was the only 
one who saw her for what she was — a freak! But for my mother 
and father, oh no, it was Lily this and Lily that, they were proud of 
having a witch in the family!” 
She stopped to draw a deep breath and then went ranting on. It 
seemed she had been wanting to say all this for years. 
“Then she met that Potter at school and they left and got married and had you, and of course I knew you’d be just the same, just 
as strange, just as — as — abnormal — and then, if you please, she 
went and got herself blown up and we got landed with you!” 
Harry had gone very white. As soon as he found his voice he 
said, “Blown up? You told me they died in a car crash!” 
“CAR CRASH!” roared Hagrid, jumping up so angrily that the 
Dursleys scuttled back to their corner. “How could a car crash kill 
Lily an’ James Potter? It’s an outrage! A scandal! Harry Potter not 
knowin’ his own story when every kid in our world knows his 
name!” 
CHAPTER FOUR 
 54 
“But why? What happened?” Harry asked urgently. 
The anger faded from Hagrid’s face. He looked suddenly anxious. 
“I never expected this,” he said, in a low, worried voice. “I had 
no idea, when Dumbledore told me there might be trouble gettin’ 
hold of yeh, how much yeh didn’t know. Ah, Harry, I don’ know if 
I’m the right person ter tell yeh — but someone’s gotta — yeh can’t 
go off ter Hogwarts not knowin’.” 
He threw a dirty look at the Dursleys. 
“Well, it’s best yeh know as much as I can tell yeh — mind, I 
can’t tell yeh everythin’, it’s a great myst’ry, parts of it. . . .” 
He sat down, stared into the fire for a few seconds, and then 
said, “It begins, I suppose, with — with a person called — but it’s 
incredible yeh don’t know his name, everyone in our world 
knows —” 
“Who?” 
“Well — I don’ like sayin’ the name if I can help it. No one 
does.” 
“Why not?” 
“Gulpin’ gargoyles, Harry, people are still scared. Blimey, this is 
difficult. See, there was this wizard who went . . . bad. As bad as 
you could go. Worse. Worse than worse. His name was . . .” 
Hagrid gulped, but no words came out. 
“Could you write it down?” Harry suggested. 
“Nah — can’t spell it. All right — Voldemort.” Hagrid shuddered. “Don’ make me say it again. Anyway, this — this wizard, 
about twenty years ago now, started lookin’ fer followers. Got ’em, 
too — some were afraid, some just wanted a bit o’ his power, ’cause 
he was gettin’ himself power, all right. Dark days, Harry. Didn’t

know who ter trust, didn’t dare get friendly with strange wizards or 
witches . . . terrible things happened. He was takin’ over. ’Course, 
some stood up to him — an’ he killed ’em. Horribly. One o’ the 
only safe places left was Hogwarts. Reckon Dumbledore’s the only 
one You-Know-Who was afraid of. Didn’t dare try takin’ the 
school, not jus’ then, anyway. 
“Now, yer mum an’ dad were as good a witch an’ wizard as I ever 
knew. Head boy an’ girl at Hogwarts in their day! Suppose the myst’ry is why You-Know-Who never tried to get ’em on his side before . . . probably knew they were too close ter Dumbledore ter 
want anythin’ ter do with the Dark Side. 
“Maybe he thought he could persuade ’em . . . maybe he just 
wanted ’em outta the way. All anyone knows is, he turned up in the 
village where you was all living, on Halloween ten years ago. You 
was just a year old. He came ter yer house an’ — an’ —” 
Hagrid suddenly pulled out a very dirty, spotted handkerchief 
and blew his nose with a sound like a foghorn. 
“Sorry,” he said. “But it’s that sad — knew yer mum an’ dad, an’ 
nicer people yeh couldn’t find — anyway . . . 
“You-Know-Who killed ’em. An’ then — an’ this is the real 
myst’ry of the thing — he tried to kill you, too. Wanted ter make a 
clean job of it, I suppose, or maybe he just liked killin’ by then. But 
he couldn’t do it. Never wondered how you got that mark on yer 
forehead? That was no ordinary cut. That’s what yeh get when a 
powerful, evil curse touches yeh — took care of yer mum an’ dad 
an’ yer house, even — but it didn’t work on you, an’ that’s why yer 
famous, Harry. No one ever lived after he decided ter kill ’em, no 
one except you, an’ he’d killed some o’ the best witches an’ wizards 
CHAPTER FOUR 
 56 
of the age — the McKinnons, the Bones, the Prewetts — an’ you 
was only a baby, an’ you lived.” 
Something very painful was going on in Harry’s mind. As Hagrid’s story came to a close, he saw again the blinding flash of green 
light, more clearly than he had ever remembered it before — and 
he remembered something else, for the first time in his life: a high, 
cold, cruel laugh. 
Hagrid was watching him sadly. 
“Took yeh from the ruined house myself, on Dumbledore’s orders. Brought yeh ter this lot . . .” 
“Load of old tosh,” said Uncle Vernon. Harry jumped; he had 
almost forgotten that the Dursleys were there. Uncle Vernon certainly seemed to have got back his courage. He was glaring at Hagrid and his fists were clenched. 
“Now, you listen here, boy,” he snarled, “I accept there’s something strange about you, probably nothing a good beating wouldn’t 
have cured — and as for all this about your parents, well, they were 
weirdos, no denying it, and the world’s better off without them in 
my opinion — asked for all they got, getting mixed up with these 
wizarding types — just what I expected, always knew they’d come 
to a sticky end —” 
But at that moment, Hagrid leapt from the sofa and drew a battered pink umbrella from inside his coat. Pointing this at Uncle 
Vernon like a sword, he said, “I’m warning you, Dursley — I’m 
warning you — one more word . . .” 
In danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella by a 
bearded giant, Uncle Vernon’s courage failed again; he flattened 
himself against the wall and fell silent. 
THE KEEPER OF THE KEYS 
 57 
“That’s better,” said Hagrid, breathing heavily and sitting back 
down on the sofa, which this time sagged right down to the floor. 
Harry, meanwhile, still had questions to ask, hundreds of them. 
“But what happened to Vol-, sorry — I mean, You-KnowWho?” 
“Good question, Harry. Disappeared. Vanished. Same night he 
tried ter kill you. Makes yeh even more famous. That’s the biggest 
myst’ry, see . . . he was gettin’ more an’ more powerful — why’d 
he go? 
“Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he 
had enough human left in him to die. Some say he’s still out there, 
bidin’ his time, like, but I don’ believe it. People who was on his 
side came back ter ours. Some of ’em came outta kinda trances. 
Don’ reckon they could’ve done if he was comin’ back. 
“Most of us reckon he’s still out there somewhere but lost his 
powers. Too weak to carry on. ’Cause somethin’ about you finished 
him, Harry. There was somethin’ goin’ on that night he hadn’t 
counted on — I dunno what it was, no one does — but somethin’ 
about you stumped him, all right.” 
Hagrid looked at Harry with warmth and respect blazing in his 
eyes, but Harry, instead of feeling pleased and proud, felt quite sure 
there had been a horrible mistake. A wizard? Him? How could he 
possibly be? He’d spent his life being clouted by Dudley, and bullied by Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon; if he was really a wizard, 
why hadn’t they been turned into warty toads every time they’d 
tried to lock him in his cupboard? If he’d once defeated the greatest sorcerer in the world, how come Dudley had always been able 
to kick him around like a football? 
CHAPTER FOUR 
 58 
“Hagrid,” he said quietly, “I think you must have made a mistake. I don’t think I can be a wizard.” 
To his surprise, Hagrid chuckled. 
“Not a wizard, eh? Never made things happen when you was 
scared or angry?” 
Harry looked into the fire. Now he came to think about it . . . 
every odd thing that had ever made his aunt and uncle furious with 
him had happened when he, Harry, had been upset or angry . . . 
chased by Dudley’s gang, he had somehow found himself out of 
their reach . . . dreading going to school with that ridiculous haircut, he’d managed to make it grow back . . . and the very last time 
Dudley had hit him, hadn’t he got his revenge, without even realizing he was doing it? Hadn’t he set a boa constrictor on him? 
Harry looked back at Hagrid, smiling, and saw that Hagrid was 
positively beaming at him. 
“See?” said Hagrid. “Harry Potter, not a wizard — you wait, 
you’ll be right famous at Hogwarts.” 
But Uncle Vernon wasn’t going to give in without a fight. 
“Haven’t I told you he’s not going?” he hissed. “He’s going 
to Stonewall High and he’ll be grateful for it. I’ve read those letters and he needs all sorts of rubbish — spell books and wands 
and —” 
“If he wants ter go, a great Muggle like you won’t stop him,” 
growled Hagrid. “Stop Lily an’ James Potter’s son goin’ ter Hogwarts! Yer mad. His name’s been down ever since he was born. He’s 
off ter the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world. 
Seven years there and he won’t know himself. He’ll be with youngsters of his own sort, fer a change, an’ he’ll be under the greatest 
headmaster Hogwarts ever had, Albus Dumbled—” 
THE KEEPER OF THE KEYS 
 59 
“I AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD FOOL 
TO TEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS!” yelled Uncle Vernon. 
But he had finally gone too far. Hagrid seized his umbrella and 
whirled it over his head, “NEVER —” he thundered, “— INSULT — ALBUS — DUMBLEDORE — IN — FRONT — 
OF — ME!” 
He brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to 
point at Dudley — there was a flash of violet light, a sound like a 
firecracker, a sharp squeal, and the next second, Dudley was dancing on the spot with his hands clasped over his fat bottom, howling 
in pain. When he turned his back on them, Harry saw a curly pig’s 
tail poking through a hole in his trousers. 
Uncle Vernon roared. Pulling Aunt Petunia and Dudley into the 
other room, he cast one last terrified look at Hagrid and slammed 
the door behind them. 
Hagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked his beard. 
“Shouldn’ta lost me temper,” he said ruefully, “but it didn’t work 
anyway. Meant ter turn him into a pig, but I suppose he was so 
much like a pig anyway there wasn’t much left ter do.” 
He cast a sideways look at Harry under his bushy eyebrows. 
“Be grateful if yeh didn’t mention that ter anyone at Hogwarts,” 
he said. “I’m — er — not supposed ter do magic, strictly speakin’. 
I was allowed ter do a bit ter follow yeh an’ get yer letters to yeh an’ 
stuff — one o’ the reasons I was so keen ter take on the job —” 
“Why aren’t you supposed to do magic?” asked Harry. 
“Oh, well — I was at Hogwarts meself but I — er — got expelled, ter tell yeh the truth. In me third year. They snapped me 
wand in half an’ everything. But Dumbledore let me stay on as 
gamekeeper. Great man, Dumbledore.” 
CHAPTER FOUR 
 60 
“Why were you expelled?” 
“It’s gettin’ late and we’ve got lots ter do tomorrow,” said Hagrid 
loudly. “Gotta get up ter town, get all yer books an’ that.” 
He took off his thick black coat and threw it to Harry. 
“You can kip under that,” he said. “Don’ mind if it wriggles a 
bit, I think I still got a couple o’ dormice in one o’ the pockets.”

arry woke early the next morning. Although he could tell 
it was daylight, he kept his eyes shut tight. 
“It was a dream,” he told himself firmly. “I dreamed a giant 
called Hagrid came to tell me I was going to a school for wizards. 
When I open my eyes I’ll be at home in my cupboard.” 
There was suddenly a loud tapping noise. 
And there’s Aunt Petunia knocking on the door, Harry thought, his 
heart sinking. But he still didn’t open his eyes. It had been such a 
good dream. 
Tap. Tap. Tap. 
“All right,” Harry mumbled, “I’m getting up.” 
He sat up and Hagrid’s heavy coat fell off him. The hut was full 
of sunlight, the storm was over, Hagrid himself was asleep on the 
collapsed sofa, and there was an owl rapping its claw on the window, a newspaper held in its beak. 
H 
CHAPTER FIVE 
 62 
Harry scrambled to his feet, so happy he felt as though a large 
balloon was swelling inside him. He went straight to the window 
and jerked it open. The owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of Hagrid, who didn’t wake up. The owl then fluttered 
onto the floor and began to attack Hagrid’s coat. 
“Don’t do that.” 
Harry tried to wave the owl out of the way, but it snapped its 
beak fiercely at him and carried on savaging the coat. 
“Hagrid!” said Harry loudly. “There’s an owl —” 
“Pay him,” Hagrid grunted into the sofa. 
“What?” 
“He wants payin’ fer deliverin’ the paper. Look in the pockets.” 
Hagrid’s coat seemed to be made of nothing but pockets — 
bunches of keys, slug pellets, balls of string, peppermint humbugs, 
teabags . . . finally, Harry pulled out a handful of strange-looking 
coins. 
“Give him five Knuts,” said Hagrid sleepily. 
“Knuts?” 
“The little bronze ones.” 
Harry counted out five little bronze coins, and the owl held out 
his leg so Harry could put the money into a small leather pouch 
tied to it. Then he flew off through the open window. 
Hagrid yawned loudly, sat up, and stretched. 
“Best be off, Harry, lots ter do today, gotta get up ter London an’ 
buy all yer stuff fer school.” 
Harry was turning over the wizard coins and looking at them. 
He had just thought of something that made him feel as though 
the happy balloon inside him had got a puncture. 
DIAGON ALLEY 
 63 
“Um — Hagrid?” 
“Mm?” said Hagrid, who was pulling on his huge boots. 
“I haven’t got any money — and you heard Uncle Vernon last 
night . . . he won’t pay for me to go and learn magic.” 
“Don’t worry about that,” said Hagrid, standing up and scratching his head. “D’yeh think yer parents didn’t leave yeh anything?” 
“But if their house was destroyed —” 
“They didn’ keep their gold in the house, boy! Nah, first stop fer 
us is Gringotts. Wizards’ bank. Have a sausage, they’re not bad 
cold — an’ I wouldn’ say no teh a bit o’ yer birthday cake, neither.” 
“Wizards have banks?” 
“Just the one. Gringotts. Run by goblins.” 
Harry dropped the bit of sausage he was holding. 
“Goblins?” 
“Yeah — so yeh’d be mad ter try an’ rob it, I’ll tell yeh that. 
Never mess with goblins, Harry. Gringotts is the safest place in the 
world fer anything yeh want ter keep safe — ’cept maybe Hogwarts. As a matter o’ fact, I gotta visit Gringotts anyway Fer Dumbledore. Hogwarts business.” Hagrid drew himself up proudly. 
“He usually gets me ter do important stuff fer him. Fetchin’ you — 
gettin’ things from Gringotts — knows he can trust me, see. 
“Got everythin’? Come on, then.” 
Harry followed Hagrid out onto the rock. The sky was quite 
clear now and the sea gleamed in the sunlight. The boat Uncle Vernon had hired was still there, with a lot of water in the bottom after the storm. 
“How did you get here?” Harry asked, looking around for another boat. 
CHAPTER FIVE 
 64 
“Flew,” said Hagrid. 
“Flew?” 
“Yeah — but we’ll go back in this. Not s’pposed ter use magic 
now I’ve got yeh.” 
They settled down in the boat, Harry still staring at Hagrid, trying to imagine him flying. 
“Seems a shame ter row, though,” said Hagrid, giving Harry another of his sideways looks. “If I was ter — er — speed things up a 
bit, would yeh mind not mentionin’ it at Hogwarts?” 
“Of course not,” said Harry, eager to see more magic. Hagrid 
pulled out the pink umbrella again, tapped it twice on the side of 
the boat, and they sped off toward land. 
“Why would you be mad to try and rob Gringotts?” Harry 
asked. 
“Spells — enchantments,” said Hagrid, unfolding his newspaper as he spoke. “They say there’s dragons guardin’ the highsecurity vaults. And then yeh gotta find yer way — Gringotts is 
hundreds of miles under London, see. Deep under the Underground. Yeh’d die of hunger tryin’ ter get out, even if yeh did manage ter get yer hands on summat.” 
Harry sat and thought about this while Hagrid read his newspaper, the Daily Prophet. Harry had learned from Uncle Vernon that 
people liked to be left alone while they did this, but it was very difficult, he’d never had so many questions in his life. 
“Ministry o’ Magic messin’ things up as usual,” Hagrid muttered, turning the page. 
“There’s a Ministry of Magic?” Harry asked, before he could 
stop himself. 
“ ’Course,” said Hagrid. “They wanted Dumbledore fer Minis-
DIAGON ALLEY 
 65 
ter, o’ course, but he’d never leave Hogwarts, so old Cornelius 
Fudge got the job. Bungler if ever there was one. So he pelts Dumbledore with owls every morning, askin’ fer advice.” 
“But what does a Ministry of Magic do?” 
“Well, their main job is to keep it from the Muggles that there’s 
still witches an’ wizards up an’ down the country.” 
“Why?” 
“Why? Blimey, Harry, everyone’d be wantin’ magic solutions to 
their problems. Nah, we’re best left alone.” 
At this moment the boat bumped gently into the harbor wall. 
Hagrid folded up his newspaper, and they clambered up the stone 
steps onto the street. 
Passersby stared a lot at Hagrid as they walked through the little 
town to the station. Harry couldn’t blame them. Not only was Hagrid twice as tall as anyone else, he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary things like parking meters and saying loudly, “See that, Harry? 
Things these Muggles dream up, eh?” 
“Hagrid,” said Harry, panting a bit as he ran to keep up, “did 
you say there are dragons at Gringotts?” 
“Well, so they say,” said Hagrid. “Crikey, I’d like a dragon.” 
“You’d like one?” 
“Wanted one ever since I was a kid — here we go.” 
They had reached the station. There was a train to London 
in five minutes’ time. Hagrid, who didn’t understand “Muggle 
money,” as he called it, gave the bills to Harry so he could buy their 
tickets. 
People stared more than ever on the train. Hagrid took up two 
seats and sat knitting what looked like a canary-yellow circus tent. 
“Still got yer letter, Harry?” he asked as he counted stitches. 
CHAPTER FIVE 
 66 
Harry took the parchment envelope out of his pocket. 
“Good,” said Hagrid. “There’s a list there of everything yeh 
need.” 
Harry unfolded a second piece of paper he hadn’t noticed the 
night before, and read:

“Can we buy all this in London?” Harry wondered aloud. 
“If yeh know where to go,” said Hagrid. 
Harry had never been to London before. Although Hagrid seemed 
to know where he was going, he was obviously not used to getting 
there in an ordinary way. He got stuck in the ticket barrier on the 
Underground, and complained loudly that the seats were too small 
and the trains too slow. 
“I don’t know how the Muggles manage without magic,” he said 
as they climbed a broken-down escalator that led up to a bustling 
road lined with shops. 
Hagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily; all Harry 
CHAPTER FIVE 
 68 
had to do was keep close behind him. They passed book shops and 
music stores, hamburger restaurants and cinemas, but nowhere 
that looked as if it could sell you a magic wand. This was just an 
ordinary street full of ordinary people. Could there really be piles 
of wizard gold buried miles beneath them? Were there really 
shops that sold spell books and broomsticks? Might this not all 
be some huge joke that the Dursleys had cooked up? If Harry 
hadn’t known that the Dursleys had no sense of humor, he might 
have thought so; yet somehow, even though everything Hagrid 
had told him so far was unbelievable, Harry couldn’t help trusting 
him. 
“This is it,” said Hagrid, coming to a halt, “the Leaky Cauldron. 
It’s a famous place.” 
It was a tiny, grubby-looking pub. If Hagrid hadn’t pointed it 
out, Harry wouldn’t have noticed it was there. The people hurrying 
by didn’t glance at it. Their eyes slid from the big book shop on one 
side to the record shop on the other as if they couldn’t see the Leaky 
Cauldron at all. In fact, Harry had the most peculiar feeling that 
only he and Hagrid could see it. Before he could mention this, Hagrid had steered him inside. 
For a famous place, it was very dark and shabby. A few old 
women were sitting in a corner, drinking tiny glasses of sherry. One 
of them was smoking a long pipe. A little man in a top hat was talking to the old bartender, who was quite bald and looked like a 
toothless walnut. The low buzz of chatter stopped when they 
walked in. Everyone seemed to know Hagrid; they waved and 
smiled at him, and the bartender reached for a glass, saying, “The 
usual, Hagrid?” 
DIAGON ALLEY 
 69 
“Can’t, Tom, I’m on Hogwarts business,” said Hagrid, clapping 
his great hand on Harry’s shoulder and making Harry’s knees 
buckle. 
“Good Lord,” said the bartender, peering at Harry, “is this — 
can this be — ?” 
The Leaky Cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and 
silent. 
“Bless my soul,” whispered the old bartender, “Harry Potter . . . 
what an honor.” 
He hurried out from behind the bar, rushed toward Harry and 
seized his hand, tears in his eyes. 
“Welcome back, Mr. Potter, welcome back.” 
Harry didn’t know what to say. Everyone was looking at him. 
The old woman with the pipe was puffing on it without realizing it 
had gone out. Hagrid was beaming. 
Then there was a great scraping of chairs and the next moment, 
Harry found himself shaking hands with everyone in the Leaky 
Cauldron. 
“Doris Crockford, Mr. Potter, can’t believe I’m meeting you at 
last.” 
“So proud, Mr. Potter, I’m just so proud.” 
“Always wanted to shake your hand — I’m all of a flutter.” 
“Delighted, Mr. Potter, just can’t tell you, Diggle’s the name, 
Dedalus Diggle.” 
“I’ve seen you before!” said Harry, as Dedalus Diggle’s top hat 
fell off in his excitement. “You bowed to me once in a shop.” 
“He remembers!” cried Dedalus Diggle, looking around at 
everyone. “Did you hear that? He remembers me!” 
CHAPTER FIVE 
 70 
Harry shook hands again and again — Doris Crockford kept 
coming back for more. 
A pale young man made his way forward, very nervously. One of 
his eyes was twitching. 
“Professor Quirrell!” said Hagrid. “Harry, Professor Quirrell will 
be one of your teachers at Hogwarts.” 
“P-P-Potter,” stammered Professor Quirrell, grasping Harry’s 
hand, “c-can’t t-tell you how p-pleased I am to meet you.” 
“What sort of magic do you teach, Professor Quirrell?” 
“D-Defense Against the D-D-Dark Arts,” muttered Professor 
Quirrell, as though he’d rather not think about it. “N-not that 
you n-need it, eh, P-P-Potter?” He laughed nervously. “You’ll be 
g-getting all your equipment, I suppose? I’ve g-got to p-pick up a 
new b-book on vampires, m-myself.” He looked terrified at the 
very thought. 
But the others wouldn’t let Professor Quirrell keep Harry to 
himself. It took almost ten minutes to get away from them all. At 
last, Hagrid managed to make himself heard over the babble. 
“Must get on — lots ter buy. Come on, Harry.” 
Doris Crockford shook Harry’s hand one last time, and Hagrid 
led them through the bar and out into a small, walled courtyard, 
where there was nothing but a trash can and a few weeds. 
Hagrid grinned at Harry. 
“Told yeh, didn’t I? Told yeh you was famous. Even Professor 
Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind you, he’s usually tremblin’.” 
“Is he always that nervous?” 
“Oh, yeah. Poor bloke. Brilliant mind. He was fine while he was 
DIAGON ALLEY 
 71 
studyin’ outta books but then he took a year off ter get some firsthand experience. . . . They say he met vampires in the Black Forest, 
and there was a nasty bit o’ trouble with a hag — never been the 
same since. Scared of the students, scared of his own subject — 
now, where’s me umbrella?” 
Vampires? Hags? Harry’s head was swimming. Hagrid, meanwhile, was counting bricks in the wall above the trash can. 
“Three up . . . two across . . .” he muttered. “Right, stand back, 
Harry.” 
He tapped the wall three times with the point of his umbrella. 
The brick he had touched quivered — it wriggled — in the 
middle, a small hole appeared — it grew wider and wider — a second later they were facing an archway large enough even for Hagrid, an archway onto a cobbled street that twisted and turned out 
of sight. 
“Welcome,” said Hagrid, “to Diagon Alley.” 
He grinned at Harry’s amazement. They stepped through the 
archway. Harry looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly back into solid wall. 
The sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest shop. Cauldrons — All Sizes — Copper, Brass, Pewter, Silver — Self-Stirring — Collapsible, said a sign hanging over them. 
“Yeah, you’ll be needin’ one,” said Hagrid, “but we gotta get yer 
money first.” 
Harry wished he had about eight more eyes. He turned his head 
in every direction as they walked up the street, trying to look at 
everything at once: the shops, the things outside them, the people 
doing their shopping. A plump woman outside an Apothecary was 
CHAPTER FIVE 
 72 
shaking her head as they passed, saying, “Dragon liver, sixteen 
Sickles an ounce, they’re mad. 
A low, soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying 
Eeylops Owl Emporium — Tawny, Screech, Barn, Brown, and 
Snowy. Several boys of about Harry’s age had their noses pressed 
against a window with broomsticks in it. “Look,” Harry heard one 
of them say, “the new Nimbus Two Thousand — fastest ever —” 
There were shops selling robes, shops selling telescopes and strange 
silver instruments Harry had never seen before, windows stacked 
with barrels of bat spleens and eels’ eyes, tottering piles of spell 
books, quills, and rolls of parchment, potion bottles, globes of the 
moon. . . . 
“Gringotts,” said Hagrid. 
They had reached a snowy white building that towered over the 
other little shops. Standing beside its burnished bronze doors, 
wearing a uniform of scarlet and gold, was — 
“Yeah, that’s a goblin,” said Hagrid quietly as they walked up the 
white stone steps toward him. The goblin was about a head shorter 
than Harry. He had a swarthy, clever face, a pointed beard and, 
Harry noticed, very long fingers and feet. He bowed as they walked 
inside. Now they were facing a second pair of doors, silver this 
time, with words engraved upon them: 
Enter, stranger, but take heed 
Of what awaits the sin of greed, 
For those who take, but do not earn, 
Must pay most dearly in their turn. 
So if you seek beneath our floors 
A treasure that was never yours,
DIAGON ALLEY 
 73 
Thief, you have been warned, beware 
Of finding more than treasure there.
“Like I said, yeh’d be mad ter try an’ rob it,” said Hagrid. 
A pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they 
were in a vast marble hall. About a hundred more goblins were sitting on high stools behind a long counter, scribbling in large 
ledgers, weighing coins in brass scales, examining precious stones 
through eyeglasses. There were too many doors to count leading off 
the hall, and yet more goblins were showing people in and out of 
these. Hagrid and Harry made for the counter. 
“Morning,” said Hagrid to a free goblin. “We’ve come ter take 
some money outta Mr. Harry Potter’s safe.” 
“You have his key, sir?” 
“Got it here somewhere,” said Hagrid, and he started emptying 
his pockets onto the counter, scattering a handful of moldy dog 
biscuits over the goblins book of numbers. The goblin wrinkled his 
nose. Harry watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as glowing coals. 
“Got it,” said Hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden key. 
The goblin looked at it closely. 
“That seems to be in order.” 
“An’ I’ve also got a letter here from Professor Dumbledore,” said 
Hagrid importantly, throwing out his chest. “It’s about the YouKnow-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen.” 
The goblin read the letter carefully. 
“Very well,” he said, handing it back to Hagrid, “I will have 
someone take you down to both vaults. Griphook!” 
Griphook was yet another goblin. Once Hagrid had crammed 
CHAPTER FIVE 
 74 
all the dog biscuits back inside his pockets, he and Harry followed 
Griphook toward one of the doors leading off the hall. 
“What’s the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen?” Harry asked. 
“Can’t tell yeh that,” said Hagrid mysteriously. “Very secret. 
Hogwarts business. Dumbledore’s trusted me. More’n my job’s 
worth ter tell yeh that.” 
Griphook held the door open for them. Harry, who had expected more marble, was surprised. They were in a narrow stone 
passageway lit with flaming torches. It sloped steeply downward and there were little railway tracks on the floor. Griphook 
whistled and a small cart came hurtling up the tracks toward 
them. They climbed in — Hagrid with some difficulty — and 
were off. 
At first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages. 
Harry tried to remember, left, right, right, left, middle fork, right, 
left, but it was impossible. The rattling cart seemed to know its 
own way, because Griphook wasn’t steering. 
Harry’s eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, but he kept 
them wide open. Once, he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end 
of a passage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon, but too 
late — they plunged even deeper, passing an underground lake 
where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and 
floor. 
“I never know,” Harry called to Hagrid over the noise of the 
cart, “what’s the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite?” 
“Stalagmite’s got an ‘m’ in it,” said Hagrid. “An’ don’ ask me 
questions just now, I think I’m gonna be sick.” 
DIAGON ALLEY 
 75 
He did look very green, and when the cart stopped at last beside 
a small door in the passage wall, Hagrid got out and had to lean 
against the wall to stop his knees from trembling. 
Griphook unlocked the door. A lot of green smoke came billowing out, and as it cleared, Harry gasped. Inside were mounds of 
gold coins. Columns of silver. Heaps of little bronze Knuts. 
“All yours,” smiled Hagrid. 
All Harry’s — it was incredible. The Dursleys couldn’t have 
known about this or they’d have had it from him faster than blinking. How often had they complained how much Harry cost them 
to keep? And all the time there had been a small fortune belonging 
to him, buried deep under London. 
Hagrid helped Harry pile some of it into a bag. 
“The gold ones are Galleons,” he explained. “Seventeen silver 
Sickles to a Galleon and twenty-nine Knuts to a Sickle, it’s 
easy enough. Right, that should be enough fer a couple o’ terms, 
we’ll keep the rest safe for yeh.” He turned to Griphook. “Vault 
seven hundred and thirteen now, please, and can we go more 
slowly?” 
“One speed only,” said Griphook. 
They were going even deeper now and gathering speed. The air 
became colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners. They 
went rattling over an underground ravine, and Harry leaned over 
the side to try to see what was down at the dark bottom, but Hagrid groaned and pulled him back by the scruff of his neck. 
Vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole. 
“Stand back,” said Griphook importantly. He stroked the door 
gently with one of his long fingers and it simply melted away. 
CHAPTER FIVE 
 76 
“If anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that, they’d be sucked 
through the door and trapped in there,” said Griphook. 
“How often do you check to see if anyone’s inside?” Harry asked. 
“About once every ten years,” said Griphook with a rather nasty 
grin. 
Something really extraordinary had to be inside this top security 
vault, Harry was sure, and he leaned forward eagerly, expecting to 
see fabulous jewels at the very least — but at first he thought it was 
empty. Then he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in 
brown paper lying on the floor. Hagrid picked it up and tucked it 
deep inside his coat. Harry longed to know what it was, but knew 
better than to ask. 
“Come on, back in this infernal cart, and don’t talk to me on the 
way back, it’s best if I keep me mouth shut,” said Hagrid. 
One wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight outside 
Gringotts. Harry didn’t know where to run first now that he had a 
bag full of money. He didn’t have to know how many Galleons 
there were to a pound to know that he was holding more money 
than he’d had in his whole life — more money than even Dudley 
had ever had. 
“Might as well get yer uniform,” said Hagrid, nodding toward 
Madam Malkin’s Robes for All Occasions. “Listen, Harry, would 
yeh mind if I slipped off fer a pick-me-up in the Leaky Cauldron? 
I hate them Gringotts carts.” He did still look a bit sick, so Harry 
entered Madam Malkin’s shop alone, feeling nervous. 
Madam Malkin was a squat, smiling witch dressed all in 
mauve. 
DIAGON ALLEY 
 77 
“Hogwarts, dear?” she said, when Harry started to speak. “Got 
the lot here — another young man being fitted up just now, in 
fact.” 
In the back of the shop, a boy with a pale, pointed face was 
standing on a footstool while a second witch pinned up his long 
black robes. Madam Malkin stood Harry on a stool next to him, 
slipped a long robe over his head, and began to pin it to the right 
length. 
“Hello,” said the boy, “Hogwarts, too?” 
“Yes,” said Harry. 
“My father’s next door buying my books and mother’s up the 
street looking at wands,” said the boy. He had a bored, drawling 
voice. “Then I’m going to drag them off to look at racing brooms. 
I don’t see why first years can’t have their own. I think I’ll bully father into getting me one and I’ll smuggle it in somehow.” 
Harry was strongly reminded of Dudley. 
“Have you got your own broom?” the boy went on. 
“No,” said Harry. 
“Play Quidditch at all?” 
“No,” Harry said again, wondering what on earth Quidditch 
could be. 
“I do — Father says it’s a crime if I’m not picked to play for 
my House, and I must say, I agree. Know what House you’ll be in 
yet?” 
“No,” said Harry, feeling more stupid by the minute. 
“Well, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but I 
know I’ll be in Slytherin, all our family have been — imagine being in Hufflepuff, I think I’d leave, wouldn’t you?” 
CHAPTER FIVE 
 78 
“Mmm,” said Harry, wishing he could say something a bit more 
interesting. 
“I say, look at that man!” said the boy suddenly, nodding toward 
the front window. Hagrid was standing there, grinning at Harry 
and pointing at two large ice creams to show he couldn’t come in. 
“That’s Hagrid,” said Harry, pleased to know something the boy 
didn’t. “He works at Hogwarts.” 
“Oh,” said the boy, “I’ve heard of him. He’s a sort of servant, 
isn’t he?” 
“He’s the gamekeeper,” said Harry. He was liking the boy less 
and less every second. 
“Yes, exactly. I heard he’s a sort of savage — lives in a hut on the 
school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to do 
magic, and ends up setting fire to his bed.” 
“I think he’s brilliant,” said Harry coldly. 
“Do you?” said the boy, with a slight sneer. “Why is he with you? 
Where are your parents?” 
“They’re dead,” said Harry shortly. He didn’t feel much like going into the matter with this boy. 
“Oh, sorry,” said the other, not sounding sorry at all. “But they 
were our kind, weren’t they?” 
“They were a witch and wizard, if that’s what you mean.” 
“I really don’t think they should let the other sort in, do you? 
They’re just not the same, they’ve never been brought up to know 
our ways. Some of them have never even heard of Hogwarts until 
they get the letter, imagine. I think they should keep it in the old 
wizarding families. What’s your surname, anyway?” 
But before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said, “That’s 
DIAGON ALLEY 
 79 
you done, my dear,” and Harry, not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy, hopped down from the footstool. 
“Well, I’ll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose,” said the drawling 
boy. 
Harry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream Hagrid had 
bought him (chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts). 
“What’s up?” said Hagrid. 
“Nothing,” Harry lied. They stopped to buy parchment and 
quills. Harry cheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that 
changed color as you wrote. When they had left the shop, he said, 
“Hagrid, what’s Quidditch?” 
“Blimey, Harry, I keep forgettin’ how little yeh know — not 
knowin’ about Quidditch!” 
“Don’t make me feel worse,” said Harry. He told Hagrid about 
the pale boy in Madam Malkin’s. 
“— and he said people from Muggle families shouldn’t even be 
allowed in —” 
“Yer not from a Muggle family. If he’d known who yeh were — 
he’s grown up knowin’ yer name if his parents are wizardin’ folk. 
You saw what everyone in the Leaky Cauldron was like when they 
saw yeh. Anyway, what does he know about it, some o’ the best I 
ever saw were the only ones with magic in ’em in a long line o’ 
Muggles — look at yer mum! Look what she had fer a sister!” 
“So what is Quidditch?” 
“It’s our sport. Wizard sport. It’s like — like soccer in the 
Muggle world — everyone follows Quidditch — played up in the 
air on broomsticks and there’s four balls — sorta hard ter explain 
the rules.” 
CHAPTER FIVE 
 80 
“And what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff?” 
“School Houses. There’s four. Everyone says Hufflepuff are a lot 
o’ duffers, but —” 
“I bet I’m in Hufflepuff,” said Harry gloomily. 
“Better Hufflepuff than Slytherin,” said Hagrid darkly. “There’s 
not a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn’t in Slytherin. 
You-Know-Who was one.” 
“Vol-, sorry — You-Know-Who was at Hogwarts?” 
“Years an’ years ago,” said Hagrid. 
They bought Harry’s school books in a shop called Flourish and 
Blotts where the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as 
large as paving stones bound in leather; books the size of postage 
stamps in covers of silk; books full of peculiar symbols and a few 
books with nothing in them at all. Even Dudley, who never read 
anything, would have been wild to get his hands on some of these. 
Hagrid almost had to drag Harry away from Curses and Countercurses (Bewitch Your Friends and Befuddle Your Enemies with the 
Latest Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly-Legs, Tongue-Tying and Much, Much 
More) by Professor Vindictus Viridian. 
“I was trying to find out how to curse Dudley.” 
“I’m not sayin’ that’s not a good idea, but yer not ter use magic 
in the Muggle world except in very special circumstances,” said 
Hagrid. “An’ anyway, yeh couldn’ work any of them curses yet, 
yeh’ll need a lot more study before yeh get ter that level.” 
Hagrid wouldn’t let Harry buy a solid gold cauldron, either (“It 
says pewter on yer list”), but they got a nice set of scales for weighing potion ingredients and a collapsible brass telescope. Then they 
visited the Apothecary, which was fascinating enough to make up 
DIAGON ALLEY 
 81 
for its horrible smell, a mixture of bad eggs and rotted cabbages. 
Barrels of slimy stuff stood on the floor; jars of herbs, dried roots, 
and bright powders lined the walls; bundles of feathers, strings of 
fangs, and snarled claws hung from the ceiling. While Hagrid 
asked the man behind the counter for a supply of some basic potion ingredients for Harry, Harry himself examined silver unicorn 
horns at twenty-one Galleons each and minuscule, glittery-black 
beetle eyes (five Knuts a scoop). 
Outside the Apothecary, Hagrid checked Harry’s list again. 
“Just yer wand left — oh yeah, an’ I still haven’t got yeh a birthday present.” 
Harry felt himself go red. 
“You don’t have to —” 
“I know I don’t have to. Tell yeh what, I’ll get yer animal. Not a 
toad, toads went outta fashion years ago, yeh’d be laughed at — an’ 
I don’ like cats, they make me sneeze. I’ll get yer an owl. All the kids 
want owls, they’re dead useful, carry yer mail an’ everythin’.” 
Twenty minutes later, they left Eeylops Owl Emporium, which 
had been dark and full of rustling and flickering, jewel-bright eyes. 
Harry now carried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl, fast 
asleep with her head under her wing. He couldn’t stop stammering 
his thanks, sounding just like Professor Quirrell. 
“Don’ mention it,” said Hagrid gruffly. “Don’ expect you’ve had 
a lotta presents from them Dursleys. Just Ollivanders left now — 
only place fer wands, Ollivanders, and yeh gotta have the best 
wand.” 
A magic wand . . . this was what Harry had been really looking 
forward to. 
CHAPTER FIVE 
 82 
The last shop was narrow and shabby. Peeling gold letters over 
the door read Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands since 382b.c. A 
single wand lay on a faded purple cushion in the dusty window. 
A tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they 
stepped inside. It was a tiny place, empty except for a single, 
spindly chair that Hagrid sat on to wait. Harry felt strangely as 
though he had entered a very strict library; he swallowed a lot of 
new questions that had just occurred to him and looked instead at 
the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling. 
For some reason, the back of his neck prickled. The very dust and 
silence in here seemed to tingle with some secret magic. 
“Good afternoon,” said a soft voice. Harry jumped. Hagrid 
must have jumped, too, because there was a loud crunching noise 
and he got quickly off the spindly chair. 
An old man was standing before them, his wide, pale eyes shining like moons through the gloom of the shop. 
“Hello,” said Harry awkwardly. 
“Ah yes,” said the man. “Yes, yes. I thought I’d be seeing you 
soon. Harry Potter.” It wasn’t a question. “You have your mother’s 
eyes. It seems only yesterday she was in here herself, buying her first 
wand. Ten and a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow. Nice 
wand for charm work.” 
Mr. Ollivander moved closer to Harry. Harry wished he would 
blink. Those silvery eyes were a bit creepy. 
“Your father, on the other hand, favored a mahogany wand. 
Eleven inches. Pliable. A little more power and excellent for transfiguration. Well, I say your father favored it — it’s really the wand 
that chooses the wizard, of course.” 
DIAGON ALLEY 
 83 
Mr. Ollivander had come so close that he and Harry were almost 
nose to nose. Harry could see himself reflected in those misty eyes. 
“And that’s where . . .” 
Mr. Ollivander touched the lightning scar on Harry’s forehead 
with a long, white finger. 
“I’m sorry to say I sold the wand that did it,” he said softly. 
“Thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Powerful wand, very powerful, 
and in the wrong hands . . . well, if I’d known what that wand was 
going out into the world to do. . . .” 
He shook his head and then, to Harry’s relief, spotted Hagrid. 
“Rubeus! Rubeus Hagrid! How nice to see you again. . . . Oak, 
sixteen inches, rather bendy, wasn’t it?” 
“It was, sir, yes,” said Hagrid. 
“Good wand, that one. But I suppose they snapped it in half 
when you got expelled?” said Mr. Ollivander, suddenly stern. 
“Er — yes, they did, yes,” said Hagrid, shuffling his feet. “I’ve 
still got the pieces, though,” he added brightly. 
“But you don’t use them?” said Mr. Ollivander sharply. 
“Oh, no, sir,” said Hagrid quickly. Harry noticed he gripped his 
pink umbrella very tightly as he spoke. 
“Hmmm,” said Mr. Ollivander, giving Hagrid a piercing look. 
“Well, now — Mr. Potter. Let me see.” He pulled a long tape measure with silver markings out of his pocket. “Which is your wand 
arm?” 
“Er — well, I’m right-handed,” said Harry. 
“Hold out your arm. That’s it.” He measured Harry from shoulder to finger, then wrist to elbow, shoulder to floor, knee to armpit 
and round his head. As he measured, he said, “Every Ollivander 
CHAPTER FIVE 
 84 
wand has a core of a powerful magical substance, Mr. Potter. We 
use unicorn hairs, phoenix tail feathers, and the heartstrings of 
dragons. No two Ollivander wands are the same, just as no two 
unicorns, dragons, or phoenixes are quite the same. And of course, 
you will never get such good results with another wizard’s wand.” 
Harry suddenly realized that the tape measure, which was measuring between his nostrils, was doing this on its own. Mr. Ollivander was flitting around the shelves, taking down boxes. 
“That will do,” he said, and the tape measure crumpled into a 
heap on the floor. “Right then, Mr. Potter. Try this one. Beechwood and dragon heartstring. Nine inches. Nice and flexible. Just 
take it and give it a wave.” 
Harry took the wand and (feeling foolish) waved it around a bit, 
but Mr. Ollivander snatched it out of his hand almost at once. 
“Maple and phoenix feather. Seven inches. Quite whippy. 
Try —” 
Harry tried — but he had hardly raised the wand when it, too, 
was snatched back by Mr. Ollivander. 
“No, no — here, ebony and unicorn hair, eight and a half 
inches, springy. Go on, go on, try it out.” 
Harry tried. And tried. He had no idea what Mr. Ollivander was 
waiting for. The pile of tried wands was mounting higher and 
higher on the spindly chair, but the more wands Mr. Ollivander 
pulled from the shelves, the happier he seemed to become. 
“Tricky customer, eh? Not to worry, we’ll find the perfect match 
here somewhere — I wonder, now — yes, why not — unusual 
combination — holly and phoenix feather, eleven inches, nice and 
supple.” 
DIAGON ALLEY 
 85 
Harry took the wand. He felt a sudden warmth in his fingers. 
He raised the wand above his head, brought it swishing down 
through the dusty air and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from 
the end like a firework, throwing dancing spots of light on to the 
walls. Hagrid whooped and clapped and Mr. Ollivander cried, 
“Oh, bravo! Yes, indeed, oh, very good. Well, well, well . . . how 
curious . . . how very curious . . .” 
He put Harry’s wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown 
paper, still muttering, “Curious . . . curious . . .” 
“Sorry,” said Harry, “but what’s curious?” 
Mr. Ollivander fixed Harry with his pale stare. 
“I remember every wand I’ve ever sold, Mr. Potter. Every single 
wand. It so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your 
wand, gave another feather — just one other. It is very curious indeed that you should be destined for this wand when its brother — 
why, its brother gave you that scar.” 
Harry swallowed. 
“Yes, thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Curious indeed how these 
things happen. The wand chooses the wizard, remember. . . . I 
think we must expect great things from you, Mr. Potter. . . . After 
all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things — terrible, 
yes, but great.” 
Harry shivered. He wasn’t sure he liked Mr. Ollivander too 
much. He paid seven gold Galleons for his wand, and Mr. Ollivander bowed them from his shop. 
The late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as Harry and Hagrid 
made their way back down Diagon Alley, back through the wall, 
CHAPTER FIVE 
 86 
back through the Leaky Cauldron, now empty. Harry didn’t speak 
at all as they walked down the road; he didn’t even notice how 
much people were gawking at them on the Underground, laden as 
they were with all their funny-shaped packages, with the snowy owl 
asleep in its cage on Harry’s lap. Up another escalator, out into 
Paddington station; Harry only realized where they were when Hagrid tapped him on the shoulder. 
“Got time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves,” he said. 
He bought Harry a hamburger and they sat down on plastic 
seats to eat them. Harry kept looking around. Everything looked so 
strange, somehow. 
“You all right, Harry? Yer very quiet,” said Hagrid. 
Harry wasn’t sure he could explain. He’d just had the best birthday of his life — and yet — he chewed his hamburger, trying to 
find the words. 
“Everyone thinks I’m special,” he said at last. “All those people in 
the Leaky Cauldron, Professor Quirrell, Mr. Ollivander . . . but I 
don’t know anything about magic at all. How can they expect great 
things? I’m famous and I can’t even remember what I’m famous for. 
I don’t know what happened when Vol-, sorry — I mean, the night 
my parents died.” 
Hagrid leaned across the table. Behind the wild beard and eyebrows he wore a very kind smile. 
“Don’ you worry, Harry. You’ll learn fast enough. Everyone 
starts at the beginning at Hogwarts, you’ll be just fine. Just be yerself. I know it’s hard. Yeh’ve been singled out, an’ that’s always hard. 
But yeh’ll have a great time at Hogwarts — I did — still do, ’smatter of fact.” 
DIAGON ALLEY 
 87 
Hagrid helped Harry on to the train that would take him back 
to the Dursleys, then handed him an envelope. 
“Yer ticket fer Hogwarts,” he said. “First o’ September — King’s 
Cross — it’s all on yer ticket. Any problems with the Dursleys, 
send me a letter with yer owl, she’ll know where to find me. . . . See 
yeh soon, Harry.” 
The train pulled out of the station. Harry wanted to watch Hagrid until he was out of sight; he rose in his seat and pressed his 
nose against the window, but he blinked and Hagrid had gone.

THE JOURNEY FROM 
PLATFORM NINE 
AND THREE-QUARTERS 
arry’s last month with the Dursleys wasn’t fun. True, 
Dudley was now so scared of Harry he wouldn’t stay in 
the same room, while Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon didn’t shut 
Harry in his cupboard, force him to do anything, or shout at 
him — in fact, they didn’t speak to him at all. Half terrified, half 
furious, they acted as though any chair with Harry in it were 
empty. Although this was an improvement in many ways, it did become a bit depressing after a while. 
Harry kept to his room, with his new owl for company. He had 
decided to call her Hedwig, a name he had found in A History of 
Magic. His school books were very interesting. He lay on his bed 
reading late into the night, Hedwig swooping in and out of the 
open window as she pleased. It was lucky that Aunt Petunia didn’t 
come in to vacuum anymore, because Hedwig kept bringing back 
dead mice. Every night before he went to sleep, Harry ticked off 
H 
THE JOURNEY FROM PLATFORM 
NINE AND THREE-QUARTERS 
 89 
another day on the piece of paper he had pinned to the wall, counting down to September the first. 
On the last day of August he thought he’d better speak to his 
aunt and uncle about getting to King’s Cross station the next day, 
so he went down to the living room where they were watching a 
quiz show on television. He cleared his throat to let them know he 
was there, and Dudley screamed and ran from the room. 
“Er — Uncle Vernon?” 
Uncle Vernon grunted to show he was listening. 
“Er — I need to be at King’s Cross tomorrow to — to go to 
Hogwarts.” 
Uncle Vernon grunted again. 
“Would it be all right if you gave me a lift?” 
Grunt. Harry supposed that meant yes. 
“Thank you.” 
He was about to go back upstairs when Uncle Vernon actually 
spoke. 
“Funny way to get to a wizards’ school, the train. Magic carpets 
all got punctures, have they?” 
Harry didn’t say anything. 
“Where is this school, anyway?” 
“I don’t know,” said Harry, realizing this for the first time. He 
pulled the ticket Hagrid had given him out of his pocket. 
“I just take the train from platform nine and three-quarters at 
eleven o’clock,” he read. 
His aunt and uncle stared. 
“Platform what?” 
“Nine and three-quarters.” 
CHAPTER SIX 
 90 
“Don’t talk rubbish,” said Uncle Vernon. “There is no platform 
nine and three-quarters.” 
“It’s on my ticket.” 
“Barking,” said Uncle Vernon, “howling mad, the lot of them. 
You’ll see. You just wait. All right, we’ll take you to King’s Cross. 
We’re going up to London tomorrow anyway, or I wouldn’t 
bother.” 
“Why are you going to London?” Harry asked, trying to keep 
things friendly. 
“Taking Dudley to the hospital,” growled Uncle Vernon. “Got 
to have that ruddy tail removed before he goes to Smeltings.” 
Harry woke at five o’clock the next morning and was too excited 
and nervous to go back to sleep. He got up and pulled on his jeans 
because he didn’t want to walk into the station in his wizard’s 
robes — he’d change on the train. He checked his Hogwarts list yet 
again to make sure he had everything he needed, saw that Hedwig 
was shut safely in her cage, and then paced the room, waiting for 
the Dursleys to get up. Two hours later, Harry’s huge, heavy trunk 
had been loaded into the Dursleys’ car, Aunt Petunia had talked 
Dudley into sitting next to Harry, and they had set off. 
They reached King’s Cross at half past ten. Uncle Vernon 
dumped Harry’s trunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station 
for him. Harry thought this was strangely kind until Uncle Vernon 
stopped dead, facing the platforms with a nasty grin on his face. 
“Well, there you are, boy. Platform nine — platform ten. Your 
platform should be somewhere in the middle, but they don’t seem 
to have built it yet, do they?” 
THE JOURNEY FROM PLATFORM 
NINE AND THREE-QUARTERS 
 91 
He was quite right, of course. There was a big plastic number 
nine over one platform and a big plastic number ten over the one 
next to it, and in the middle, nothing at all. 
“Have a good term,” said Uncle Vernon with an even nastier 
smile. He left without another word. Harry turned and saw the 
Dursleys drive away. All three of them were laughing. Harry’s 
mouth went rather dry. What on earth was he going to do? He was 
starting to attract a lot of funny looks, because of Hedwig. He’d 
have to ask someone. 
He stopped a passing guard, but didn’t dare mention platform 
nine and three-quarters. The guard had never heard of Hogwarts 
and when Harry couldn’t even tell him what part of the country it 
was in, he started to get annoyed, as though Harry was being stupid on purpose. Getting desperate, Harry asked for the train that 
left at eleven o’clock, but the guard said there wasn’t one. In the end 
the guard strode away, muttering about time wasters. Harry was 
now trying hard not to panic. According to the large clock over the 
arrivals board, he had ten minutes left to get on the train to Hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it; he was stranded in the middle of a station with a trunk he could hardly lift, a pocket full of 
wizard money, and a large owl. 
Hagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you had to 
do, like tapping the third brick on the left to get into Diagon Alley. 
He wondered if he should get out his wand and start tapping the 
ticket inspector’s stand between platforms nine and ten. 
At that moment a group of people passed just behind him and 
he caught a few words of what they were saying. 
“— packed with Muggles, of course —” 
CHAPTER SIX 
 92 
Harry swung round. The speaker was a plump woman who was 
talking to four boys, all with flaming red hair. Each of them was 
pushing a trunk like Harry’s in front of him — and they had an 
owl.
Heart hammering, Harry pushed his cart after them. They 
stopped and so did he, just near enough to hear what they were saying. 
“Now, what’s the platform number?” said the boys’ mother. 
“Nine and three-quarters!” piped a small girl, also red-headed, 
who was holding her hand, “Mom, can’t I go . . .” 
“You’re not old enough, Ginny, now be quiet. All right, Percy, 
you go first.” 
What looked like the oldest boy marched toward platforms nine 
and ten. Harry watched, careful not to blink in case he missed it — 
but just as the boy reached the dividing barrier between the two 
platforms, a large crowd of tourists came swarming in front of him 
and by the time the last backpack had cleared away, the boy had 
vanished. 
“Fred, you next,” the plump woman said. 
“I’m not Fred, I’m George,” said the boy. “Honestly, woman, 
you call yourself our mother? Can’t you tell I’m George?” 
“Sorry, George, dear.” 
“Only joking, I am Fred,” said the boy, and off he went. His 
twin called after him to hurry up, and he must have done so, because a second later, he had gone — but how had he done it? 
Now the third brother was walking briskly toward the barrier — 
he was almost there — and then, quite suddenly, he wasn’t anywhere. 
THE JOURNEY FROM PLATFORM 
NINE AND THREE-QUARTERS

There was nothing else for it. 
“Excuse me,” Harry said to the plump woman. 
“Hello, dear,” she said. “First time at Hogwarts? Ron’s new, too.” 
She pointed at the last and youngest of her sons. He was tall, 
thin, and gangling, with freckles, big hands and feet, and a long 
nose. 
“Yes,” said Harry. “The thing is — the thing is, I don’t know 
how to —” 
“How to get onto the platform?” she said kindly, and Harry 
nodded. 
“Not to worry,” she said. “All you have to do is walk straight at 
the barrier between platforms nine and ten. Don’t stop and don’t be 
scared you’ll crash into it, that’s very important. Best do it at a bit 
of a run if you’re nervous. Go on, go now before Ron.” 
“Er — okay,” said Harry. 
He pushed his trolley around and stared at the barrier. It looked 
very solid. 
He started to walk toward it. People jostled him on their way to 
platforms nine and ten. Harry walked more quickly. He was going 
to smash right into that barrier and then he’d be in trouble — leaning forward on his cart, he broke into a heavy run — the barrier 
was coming nearer and nearer — he wouldn’t be able to stop — 
the cart was out of control — he was a foot away — he closed his 
eyes ready for the crash — 
It didn’t come . . . he kept on running . . . he opened his eyes. 
A scarlet steam engine was waiting next to a platform packed 
with people. A sign overhead said Hogwarts Express, eleven 
o’clock. Harry looked behind him and saw a wrought-iron archway 
CHAPTER SIX 
 94 
where the barrier had been, with the words Platform Nine and 
Three-Quarters on it. He had done it. 
Smoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the chattering 
crowd, while cats of every color wound here and there between 
their legs. Owls hooted to one another in a disgruntled sort of way 
over the babble and the scraping of heavy trunks. 
The first few carriages were already packed with students, some 
hanging out of the window to talk to their families, some fighting 
over seats. Harry pushed his cart off down the platform in search of 
an empty seat. He passed a round-faced boy who was saying, 
“Gran, I’ve lost my toad again.” 
“Oh, Neville,” he heard the old woman sigh. 
A boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small crowd. 
“Give us a look, Lee, go on.” 
The boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms, and the people 
around him shrieked and yelled as something inside poked out a 
long, hairy leg. 
Harry pressed on through the crowd until he found an empty 
compartment near the end of the train. He put Hedwig inside first 
and then started to shove and heave his trunk toward the train 
door. He tried to lift it up the steps but could hardly raise one end 
and twice he dropped it painfully on his foot. 
“Want a hand?” It was one of the red-haired twins he’d followed 
through the barrier. 
“Yes, please,” Harry panted. 
“Oy, Fred! C’mere and help!” 
With the twins’ help, Harry’s trunk was at last tucked away in a 
corner of the compartment.

NINE AND THREE-QUARTERS 
 95 
“Thanks,” said Harry, pushing his sweaty hair out of his eyes. 
“What’s that?” said one of the twins suddenly, pointing at 
Harry’s lightning scar. 
“Blimey,” said the other twin. “Are you — ?” 
“He is,” said the first twin. “Aren’t you?” he added to Harry. 
“What?” said Harry. 
“Harry Potter,” chorused the twins. 
“Oh, him,” said Harry. “I mean, yes, I am.” 
The two boys gawked at him, and Harry felt himself turning 
red. Then, to his relief, a voice came floating in through the train’s 
open door. 
“Fred? George? Are you there?” 
“Coming, Mom.” 
With a last look at Harry, the twins hopped off the train. 
Harry sat down next to the window where, half hidden, he 
could watch the red-haired family on the platform and hear what 
they were saying. Their mother had just taken out her handkerchief. 
“Ron, you’ve got something on your nose.” 
The youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way, but she grabbed 
him and began rubbing the end of his nose. 
“Mom — geroff.” He wriggled free. 
“Aaah, has ickle Ronnie got somefink on his nosie?” said one of 
the twins. 
“Shut up,” said Ron. 
“Where’s Percy?” said their mother. 
“He’s coming now.” 
The oldest boy came striding into sight. He had already changed 
CHAPTER SIX 
 96 
into his billowing black Hogwarts robes, and Harry noticed a shiny 
red and gold badge on his chest with the letter P on it. 
“Can’t stay long, Mother,” he said. “I’m up front, the prefects 
have got two compartments to themselves —” 
“Oh, are you a prefect, Percy?” said one of the twins, with an air 
of great surprise. “You should have said something, we had no 
idea.” 
“Hang on, I think I remember him saying something about it,” 
said the other twin. “Once —” 
“Or twice —” 
“A minute —” 
“All summer —” 
“Oh, shut up,” said Percy the Prefect. 
“How come Percy gets new robes, anyway?” said one of the 
twins. 
“Because he’s a prefect,” said their mother fondly. “All right, dear, 
well, have a good term — send me an owl when you get there.” 
She kissed Percy on the cheek and he left. Then she turned to the 
twins. 
“Now, you two — this year, you behave yourselves. If I get one 
more owl telling me you’ve — you’ve blown up a toilet or —” 
“Blown up a toilet? We’ve never blown up a toilet.” 
“Great idea though, thanks, Mom.” 
“It’s not funny. And look after Ron.” 
“Don’t worry, ickle Ronniekins is safe with us.” 
“Shut up,” said Ron again. He was almost as tall as the twins already and his nose was still pink where his mother had rubbed it. 
“Hey, Mom, guess what? Guess who we just met on the train?” 
THE JOURNEY FROM PLATFORM 
NINE AND THREE-QUARTERS 
 97 
Harry leaned back quickly so they couldn’t see him looking. 
“You know that black-haired boy who was near us in the station? 
Know who he is?” 
“Who?” 
“Harry Potter!” 
Harry heard the little girl’s voice. 
“Oh, Mom, can I go on the train and see him, Mom, oh 
please. . . .” 
“You’ve already seen him, Ginny, and the poor boy isn’t something you goggle at in a zoo. Is he really, Fred? How do you know?” 
“Asked him. Saw his scar. It’s really there — like lightning.” 
“Poor dear — no wonder he was alone, I wondered. He was ever 
so polite when he asked how to get onto the platform.” 
“Never mind that, do you think he remembers what You-KnowWho looks like?” 
Their mother suddenly became very stern. 
“I forbid you to ask him, Fred. No, don’t you dare. As though he 
needs reminding of that on his first day at school.” 
“All right, keep your hair on.” 
A whistle sounded. 
“Hurry up!” their mother said, and the three boys clambered 
onto the train. They leaned out of the window for her to kiss them 
good-bye, and their younger sister began to cry. 
“Don’t, Ginny, we’ll send you loads of owls.” 
“We’ll send you a Hogwarts toilet seat.” 
“George!” 
“Only joking, Mom.” 
The train began to move. Harry saw the boys’ mother waving 
CHAPTER SIX 
 98 
and their sister, half laughing, half crying, running to keep up with 
the train until it gathered too much speed, then she fell back and 
waved. 
Harry watched the girl and her mother disappear as the train 
rounded the corner. Houses flashed past the window. Harry felt a 
great leap of excitement. He didn’t know what he was going to — 
but it had to be better than what he was leaving behind. 
The door of the compartment slid open and the youngest redheaded boy came in. 
“Anyone sitting there?” he asked, pointing at the seat opposite 
Harry. “Everywhere else is full.” 
Harry shook his head and the boy sat down. He glanced at 
Harry and then looked quickly out of the window, pretending he 
hadn’t looked. Harry saw he still had a black mark on his nose. 
“Hey, Ron.” 
The twins were back. 
“Listen, we’re going down the middle of the train — Lee Jordan’s got a giant tarantula down there.” 
“Right,” mumbled Ron. 
“Harry,” said the other twin, “did we introduce ourselves? Fred 
and George Weasley. And this is Ron, our brother. See you later, 
then.” 
“Bye,” said Harry and Ron. The twins slid the compartment 
door shut behind them. 
“Are you really Harry Potter?” Ron blurted out. 
Harry nodded. 
“Oh — well, I thought it might be one of Fred and George’s 
jokes,” said Ron. “And have you really got — you know . . .” 
THE JOURNEY FROM PLATFORM 
NINE AND THREE-QUARTERS 
 99 
He pointed at Harry’s forehead. 
Harry pulled back his bangs to show the lightning scar. Ron 
stared. 
“So that’s where You-Know-Who — ?” 
“Yes,” said Harry, “but I can’t remember it.” 
“Nothing?” said Ron eagerly. 
“Well — I remember a lot of green light, but nothing else.” 
“Wow,” said Ron. He sat and stared at Harry for a few moments, 
then, as though he had suddenly realized what he was doing, he 
looked quickly out of the window again. 
“Are all your family wizards?” asked Harry, who found Ron just 
as interesting as Ron found him. 
“Er — yes, I think so,” said Ron. “I think Mom’s got a second 
cousin who’s an accountant, but we never talk about him.” 
“So you must know loads of magic already.” 
The Weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding families 
the pale boy in Diagon Alley had talked about. 
“I heard you went to live with Muggles,” said Ron. “What are 
they like?” 
“Horrible — well, not all of them. My aunt and uncle and 
cousin are, though. Wish I’d had three wizard brothers.” 
“Five,” said Ron. For some reason, he was looking gloomy. “I’m 
the sixth in our family to go to Hogwarts. You could say I’ve got a 
lot to live up to. Bill and Charlie have already left — Bill was head 
boy and Charlie was captain of Quidditch. Now Percy’s a prefect. 
Fred and George mess around a lot, but they still get really good 
marks and everyone thinks they’re really funny. Everyone expects 
me to do as well as the others, but if I do, it’s no big deal, because 
CHAPTER SIX 
 100 
they did it first. You never get anything new, either, with five brothers. I’ve got Bill’s old robes, Charlie’s old wand, and Percy’s old rat.” 
Ron reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat gray rat, which 
was asleep. 
“His name’s Scabbers and he’s useless, he hardly ever wakes up. 
Percy got an owl from my dad for being made a prefect, but they 
couldn’t aff— I mean, I got Scabbers instead.” 
Ron’s ears went pink. He seemed to think he’d said too much, 
because he went back to staring out of the window. 
Harry didn’t think there was anything wrong with not being 
able to afford an owl. After all, he’d never had any money in his life 
until a month ago, and he told Ron so, all about having to wear 
Dudley’s old clothes and never getting proper birthday presents. 
This seemed to cheer Ron up. 
“. . . and until Hagrid told me, I didn’t know anything about being a wizard or about my parents or Voldemort —” 
Ron gasped. 
“What?” said Harry. 
“You said You-Know-Who’s name!” said Ron, sounding both 
shocked and impressed. “I’d have thought you, of all people —” 
“I’m not trying to be brave or anything, saying the name,” said 
Harry, “I just never knew you shouldn’t. See what I mean? I’ve got 
loads to learn. . . . I bet,” he added, voicing for the first time something that had been worrying him a lot lately, “I bet I’m the worst 
in the class.” 
“You won’t be. There’s loads of people who come from Muggle 
families and they learn quick enough.” 
While they had been talking, the train had carried them out 
of London. Now they were speeding past fields full of cows and 
THE JOURNEY FROM PLATFORM 
NINE AND THREE-QUARTERS 
 101 
sheep. They were quiet for a time, watching the fields and lanes 
flick past. 
Around half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in 
the corridor and a smiling, dimpled woman slid back their door 
and said, “Anything off the cart, dears?” 
Harry, who hadn’t had any breakfast, leapt to his feet, but Ron’s 
ears went pink again and he muttered that he’d brought sandwiches. Harry went out into the corridor. 
He had never had any money for candy with the Dursleys, and 
now that he had pockets rattling with gold and silver he was ready 
to buy as many Mars Bars as he could carry — but the woman 
didn’t have Mars Bars. What she did have were Bertie Bott’s Every 
Flavor Beans, Drooble’s Best Blowing Gum, Chocolate Frogs, 
Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldron Cakes, Licorice Wands, and a number 
of other strange things Harry had never seen in his life. Not wanting to miss anything, he got some of everything and paid the 
woman eleven silver Sickles and seven bronze Knuts. 
Ron stared as Harry brought it all back in to the compartment 
and tipped it onto an empty seat. 
“Hungry, are you?” 
“Starving,” said Harry, taking a large bite out of a pumpkin 
pasty. 
Ron had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped it. There 
were four sandwiches inside. He pulled one of them apart and said, 
“She always forgets I don’t like corned beef.” 
“Swap you for one of these,” said Harry, holding up a pasty. “Go 
on —” 
“You don’t want this, it’s all dry,” said Ron. “She hasn’t got much 
time,” he added quickly, “you know, with five of us.” 
CHAPTER SIX 
 102 
“Go on, have a pasty,” said Harry, who had never had anything to share before or, indeed, anyone to share it with. It was 
a nice feeling, sitting there with Ron, eating their way through 
all Harry’s pasties, cakes, and candies (the sandwiches lay forgotten). 
“What are these?” Harry asked Ron, holding up a pack of 
Chocolate Frogs. “They’re not really frogs, are they?” He was starting to feel that nothing would surprise him. 
“No,” said Ron. “But see what the card is. I’m missing Agrippa.” 
“What?” 
“Oh, of course, you wouldn’t know — Chocolate Frogs have 
cards inside them, you know, to collect — famous witches and 
wizards. I’ve got about five hundred, but I haven’t got Agrippa or 
Ptolemy.” 
Harry unwrapped his Chocolate Frog and picked up the card. It 
showed a man’s face. He wore half-moon glasses, had a long, 
crooked nose, and flowing silver hair, beard, and mustache. Underneath the picture was the name Albus Dumbledore. 
“So this is Dumbledore!” said Harry. 
“Don’t tell me you’d never heard of Dumbledore!” said Ron. 
“Can I have a frog? I might get Agrippa — thanks —” 
Harry turned over his card and read: 
ALBUS DUMBLEDORE 
currently headmaster of hogwarts 
Considered by many the greatest wizard of modern times, 
Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the 
THE JOURNEY FROM PLATFORM 
NINE AND THREE-QUARTERS 
 103 
Dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the 
twelve uses of dragon’s blood, and his work on alchemy 
with his partner, Nicolas Flamel. Professor Dumbledore 
enjoys chamber music and tenpin bowling. 
Harry turned the card back over and saw, to his astonishment, that 
Dumbledore’s face had disappeared. 
“He’s gone!” 
“Well, you can’t expect him to hang around all day,” said Ron. 
“He’ll be back. No, I’ve got Morgana again and I’ve got about six 
of her . . . do you want it? You can start collecting.” 
Ron’s eyes strayed to the pile of Chocolate Frogs waiting to be 
unwrapped. 
“Help yourself,” said Harry. “But in, you know, the Muggle 
world, people just stay put in photos.” 
“Do they? What, they don’t move at all?” Ron sounded amazed. 
“Weird!” 
Harry stared as Dumbledore sidled back into the picture on his 
card and gave him a small smile. Ron was more interested in eating 
the frogs than looking at the Famous Witches and Wizards cards, 
but Harry couldn’t keep his eyes off them. Soon he had not only 
Dumbledore and Morgana, but Hengist of Woodcraft, Alberic 
Grunnion, Circe, Paracelsus, and Merlin. He finally tore his eyes 
away from the druidess Cliodna, who was scratching her nose, to 
open a bag of Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans. 
“You want to be careful with those,” Ron warned Harry. “When 
they say every flavor, they mean every flavor — you know, you get 
all the ordinary ones like chocolate and peppermint and mar- 
CHAPTER SIX 
 104 
malade, but then you can get spinach and liver and tripe. George 
reckons he had a booger-flavored one once.” 
Ron picked up a green bean, looked at it carefully, and bit into a 
corner. 
“Bleaaargh — see? Sprouts.” 
They had a good time eating the Every Flavor Beans. Harry got 
toast, coconut, baked bean, strawberry, curry, grass, coffee, sardine, 
and was even brave enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one 
Ron wouldn’t touch, which turned out to be pepper. 
The countryside now flying past the window was becoming 
wilder. The neat fields had gone. Now there were woods, twisting 
rivers, and dark green hills. 
There was a knock on the door of their compartment and the 
round-faced boy Harry had passed on platform nine and threequarters came in. He looked tearful. 
“Sorry,” he said, “but have you seen a toad at all?” 
When they shook their heads, he wailed, “I’ve lost him! He 
keeps getting away from me!” 
“He’ll turn up,” said Harry. 
“Yes,” said the boy miserably. “Well, if you see him . . .” 
He left. 
“Don’t know why he’s so bothered,” said Ron. “If I’d brought a 
toad I’d lose it as quick as I could. Mind you, I brought Scabbers, 
so I can’t talk.” 
The rat was still snoozing on Ron’s lap. 
“He might have died and you wouldn’t know the difference,” said 
Ron in disgust. “I tried to turn him yellow yesterday to make him 
more interesting, but the spell didn’t work. I’ll show you, look . . .” 
THE JOURNEY FROM PLATFORM 
NINE AND THREE-QUARTERS 
 105 
He rummaged around in his trunk and pulled out a very 
battered-looking wand. It was chipped in places and something 
white was glinting at the end. 
“Unicorn hair’s nearly poking out. Anyway —” 
He had just raised his wand when the compartment door slid 
open again. The toadless boy was back, but this time he had a girl 
with him. She was already wearing her new Hogwarts robes. 
“Has anyone seen a toad? Neville’s lost one,” she said. She had a 
bossy sort of voice, lots of bushy brown hair, and rather large front 
teeth. 
“We’ve already told him we haven’t seen it,” said Ron, but the 
girl wasn’t listening, she was looking at the wand in his hand. 
“Oh, are you doing magic? Let’s see it, then.” 
She sat down. Ron looked taken aback. 
“Er — all right.” 
He cleared his throat. 
“Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow, 
Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow.” 
He waved his wand, but nothing happened. Scabbers stayed 
gray and fast asleep. 
“Are you sure that’s a real spell?” said the girl. “Well, it’s not very 
good, is it? I’ve tried a few simple spells just for practice and it’s all 
worked for me. Nobody in my family’s magic at all, it was ever such 
a surprise when I got my letter, but I was ever so pleased, of course, 
I mean, it’s the very best school of witchcraft there is, I’ve heard — 
I’ve learned all our course books by heart, of course, I just hope it 
CHAPTER SIX 
 106 
will be enough — I’m Hermione Granger, by the way, who are 
you?” 
She said all this very fast. 
Harry looked at Ron, and was relieved to see by his stunned face 
that he hadn’t learned all the course books by heart either. 
“I’m Ron Weasley,” Ron muttered. 
“Harry Potter,” said Harry. 
“Are you really?” said Hermione. “I know all about you, of 
course — I got a few extra books for background reading, and 
you’re in Modern Magical History and The Rise and Fall of the Dark 
Arts and Great Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century.” 
“Am I?” said Harry, feeling dazed. 
“Goodness, didn’t you know, I’d have found out everything I 
could if it was me,” said Hermione. “Do either of you know what 
House you’ll be in? I’ve been asking around, and I hope I’m in 
Gryffindor, it sounds by far the best; I hear Dumbledore himself 
was in it, but I suppose Ravenclaw wouldn’t be too bad. . . . Anyway, we’d better go and look for Neville’s toad. You two had better 
change, you know, I expect we’ll be there soon.” 
And she left, taking the toadless boy with her. 
“Whatever House I’m in, I hope she’s not in it,” said Ron. He 
threw his wand back into his trunk. “Stupid spell — George gave 
it to me, bet he knew it was a dud.” 
“What House are your brothers in?” asked Harry. 
“Gryffindor,” said Ron. Gloom seemed to be settling on him 
again. “Mom and Dad were in it, too. I don’t know what they’ll say 
if I’m not. I don’t suppose Ravenclaw would be too bad, but imagine if they put me in Slytherin.” 
THE JOURNEY FROM PLATFORM 
NINE AND THREE-QUARTERS 
 107 
“That’s the House Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who was in?” 
“Yeah,” said Ron. He flopped back into his seat, looking depressed. 
“You know, I think the ends of Scabbers’ whiskers are a bit 
lighter,” said Harry, trying to take Ron’s mind off Houses. “So 
what do your oldest brothers do now that they’ve left, anyway?” 
Harry was wondering what a wizard did once he’d finished 
school. 
“Charlie’s in Romania studying dragons, and Bill’s in Africa doing something for Gringotts,” said Ron. “Did you hear about 
Gringotts? It’s been all over the Daily Prophet, but I don’t suppose 
you get that with the Muggles — someone tried to rob a high security vault.” 
Harry stared. 
“Really? What happened to them?” 
“Nothing, that’s why it’s such big news. They haven’t been 
caught. My dad says it must’ve been a powerful Dark wizard to get 
round Gringotts, but they don’t think they took anything, that’s 
what’s odd. ’Course, everyone gets scared when something like this 
happens in case You-Know-Who’s behind it.” 
Harry turned this news over in his mind. He was starting to 
get a prickle of fear every time You-Know-Who was mentioned. 
He supposed this was all part of entering the magical world, but 
it had been a lot more comfortable saying “Voldemort” without 
worrying. 
“What’s your Quidditch team?” Ron asked. 
“Er — I don’t know any,” Harry confessed. 
“What!” Ron looked dumbfounded. “Oh, you wait, it’s the best 
CHAPTER SIX 
 108 
game in the world —” And he was off, explaining all about the 
four balls and the positions of the seven players, describing famous 
games he’d been to with his brothers and the broomstick he’d like 
to get if he had the money. He was just taking Harry through the 
finer points of the game when the compartment door slid open yet 
again, but it wasn’t Neville the toadless boy, or Hermione Granger 
this time. 
Three boys entered, and Harry recognized the middle one at 
once: It was the pale boy from Madam Malkin’s robe shop. He was 
looking at Harry with a lot more interest than he’d shown back in 
Diagon Alley. 
“Is it true?” he said. “They’re saying all down the train that 
Harry Potter’s in this compartment. So it’s you, is it?” 
“Yes,” said Harry. He was looking at the other boys. Both of 
them were thickset and looked extremely mean. Standing on either 
side of the pale boy, they looked like bodyguards. 
“Oh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle,” said the pale boy carelessly, noticing where Harry was looking. “And my names Malfoy, 
Draco Malfoy.” 
Ron gave a slight cough, which might have been hiding a snigger. Draco Malfoy looked at him. 
“Think my name’s funny, do you? No need to ask who you are. 
My father told me all the Weasleys have red hair, freckles, and more 
children than they can afford.” 
He turned back to Harry. “You’ll soon find out some wizarding 
families are much better than others, Potter. You don’t want to go 
making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there.” 
He held out his hand to shake Harry’s, but Harry didn’t take it. 
THE JOURNEY FROM PLATFORM 
NINE AND THREE-QUARTERS 
 109 
“I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks,” he 
said coolly. 
Draco Malfoy didn’t go red, but a pink tinge appeared in his pale 
cheeks. 
“I’d be careful if I were you, Potter,” he said slowly. “Unless 
you’re a bit politer you’ll go the same way as your parents. They 
didn’t know what was good for them, either. You hang around with 
riffraff like the Weasleys and that Hagrid, and it’ll rub off on you.” 
Both Harry and Ron stood up. 
“Say that again,” Ron said, his face as red as his hair. 
“Oh, you’re going to fight us, are you?” Malfoy sneered. 
“Unless you get out now,” said Harry, more bravely than he felt, 
because Crabbe and Goyle were a lot bigger than him or Ron. 
“But we don’t feel like leaving, do we, boys? We’ve eaten all our 
food and you still seem to have some.” 
Goyle reached toward the Chocolate Frogs next to Ron — Ron 
leapt forward, but before he’d so much as touched Goyle, Goyle let 
out a horrible yell. 
Scabbers the rat was hanging off his finger, sharp little teeth sunk 
deep into Goyle’s knuckle — Crabbe and Malfoy backed away as 
Goyle swung Scabbers round and round, howling, and when Scabbers finally flew off and hit the window, all three of them disappeared at once. Perhaps they thought there were more rats lurking 
among the sweets, or perhaps they’d heard footsteps, because a second later, Hermione Granger had come in. 
“What has been going on?” she said, looking at the sweets all 
over the floor and Ron picking up Scabbers by his tail. 
“I think he’s been knocked out,” Ron said to Harry. He looked 
CHAPTER SIX 
 110 
closer at Scabbers. “No — I don’t believe it — he’s gone back to 
sleep.” 
And so he had. 
“You’ve met Malfoy before?” 
Harry explained about their meeting in Diagon Alley. 
“I’ve heard of his family,” said Ron darkly. “They were some of 
the first to come back to our side after You-Know-Who disappeared. Said they’d been bewitched. My dad doesn’t believe it. He 
says Malfoy’s father didn’t need an excuse to go over to the Dark 
Side.” He turned to Hermione. “Can we help you with something?” 
“You’d better hurry up and put your robes on, I’ve just been up 
to the front to ask the conductor, and he says we’re nearly there. 
You haven’t been fighting, have you? You’ll be in trouble before we 
even get there!” 
“Scabbers has been fighting, not us,” said Ron, scowling at her. 
“Would you mind leaving while we change?” 
“All right — I only came in here because people outside are behaving very childishly, racing up and down the corridors,” said 
Hermione in a sniffy voice. “And you’ve got dirt on your nose, by 
the way, did you know?” 
Ron glared at her as she left. Harry peered out of the window. It 
was getting dark. He could see mountains and forests under a deep 
purple sky. The train did seem to be slowing down. 
He and Ron took off their jackets and pulled on their long black 
robes. Ron’s were a bit short for him, you could see his sneakers underneath them. 
A voice echoed through the train: “We will be reaching Hog-

warts in five minutes’ time. Please leave your luggage on the train, 
it will be taken to the school separately.” 
Harry’s stomach lurched with nerves and Ron, he saw, looked 
pale under his freckles. They crammed their pockets with the last 
of the sweets and joined the crowd thronging the corridor. 
The train slowed right down and finally stopped. People pushed 
their way toward the door and out on to a tiny, dark platform. 
Harry shivered in the cold night air. Then a lamp came bobbing 
over the heads of the students, and Harry heard a familiar voice: 
“Firs’ years! Firs’ years over here! All right there, Harry?” 
Hagrid’s big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads. 
“C’mon, follow me — any more firs’ years? Mind yer step, now! 
Firs’ years follow me!” 
Slipping and stumbling, they followed Hagrid down what 
seemed to be a steep, narrow path. It was so dark on either side of 
them that Harry thought there must be thick trees there. Nobody 
spoke much. Neville, the boy who kept losing his toad, sniffed 
once or twice. 
“Yeh’ll get yer firs’ sight o’ Hogwarts in a sec,” Hagrid called over 
his shoulder, “jus’ round this bend here.” 
There was a loud “Oooooh!” 
The narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge of a great 
black lake. Perched atop a high mountain on the other side, its 
windows sparkling in the starry sky, was a vast castle with many 
turrets and towers. 
“No more’n four to a boat!” Hagrid called, pointing to a fleet of 
little boats sitting in the water by the shore. Harry and Ron were 
followed into their boat by Neville and Hermione. 
CHAPTER SIX 
 112 
“Everyone in?” shouted Hagrid, who had a boat to himself. 
“Right then — FORWARD!” 
And the fleet of little boats moved off all at once, gliding across 
the lake, which was as smooth as glass. Everyone was silent, staring 
up at the great castle overhead. It towered over them as they sailed 
nearer and nearer to the cliff on which it stood. 
“Heads down!” yelled Hagrid as the first boats reached the cliff; 
they all bent their heads and the little boats carried them through a 
curtain of ivy that hid a wide opening in the cliff face. They were 
carried along a dark tunnel, which seemed to be taking them right 
underneath the castle, until they reached a kind of underground 
harbor, where they clambered out onto rocks and pebbles. 
“Oy, you there! Is this your toad?” said Hagrid, who was checking the boats as people climbed out of them. 
“Trevor!” cried Neville blissfully, holding out his hands. Then 
they clambered up a passageway in the rock after Hagrid’s lamp, 
coming out at last onto smooth, damp grass right in the shadow of 
the castle. 
They walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded around the 
huge, oak front door. 
“Everyone here? You there, still got yer toad?” 
Hagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times on the castle door.

he door swung open at once. A tall, black-haired witch in 
emerald-green robes stood there. She had a very stern face 
and Harry’s first thought was that this was not someone to cross. 
“The firs’ years, Professor McGonagall,” said Hagrid. 
“Thank you, Hagrid. I will take them from here.” 
She pulled the door wide. The entrance hall was so big you 
could have fit the whole of the Dursleys’ house in it. The stone 
walls were lit with flaming torches like the ones at Gringotts, the 
ceiling was too high to make out, and a magnificent marble staircase facing them led to the upper floors. 
They followed Professor McGonagall across the flagged stone 
floor. Harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a 
doorway to the right — the rest of the school must already be 
here — but Professor McGonagall showed the first years into a 
small, empty chamber off the hall. They crowded in, standing 
T 
CHAPTER SEVEN 
 114 
rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering 
about nervously. 
“Welcome to Hogwarts,” said Professor McGonagall. “The 
start-of-term banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your 
seats in the Great Hall, you will be sorted into your Houses. The 
Sorting is a very important ceremony because, while you are here, 
your House will be something like your family within Hogwarts. 
You will have classes with the rest of your House, sleep in your 
House dormitory, and spend free time in your House common 
room. 
“The four Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, 
and Slytherin. Each House has its own noble history and each has 
produced outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs will earn your House points, while any rulebreaking will lose House points. At the end of the year, the House 
with the most points is awarded the House cup, a great honor. I 
hope each of you will be a credit to whichever House becomes 
yours. 
“The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front 
of the rest of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as 
much as you can while you are waiting.” 
Her eyes lingered for a moment on Neville’s cloak, which was 
fastened under his left ear, and on Ron’s smudged nose. Harry nervously tried to flatten his hair. 
“I shall return when we are ready for you,” said Professor McGonagall. “Please wait quietly.” 
She left the chamber. Harry swallowed. 
“How exactly do they sort us into Houses?” he asked Ron. 
THE SORTING HAT 
 115 
“Some sort of test, I think. Fred said it hurts a lot, but I think he 
was joking.” 
Harry’s heart gave a horrible jolt. A test? In front of the whole 
school? But he didn’t know any magic yet — what on earth would 
he have to do? He hadn’t expected something like this the moment 
they arrived. He looked around anxiously and saw that everyone 
else looked terrified, too. No one was talking much except 
Hermione Granger, who was whispering very fast about all the 
spells she’d learned and wondering which one she’d need. Harry 
tried hard not to listen to her. He’d never been more nervous, 
never, not even when he’d had to take a school report home to the 
Dursleys saying that he’d somehow turned his teachers wig blue. 
He kept his eyes fixed on the door. Any second now, Professor 
McGonagall would come back and lead him to his doom. 
Then something happened that made him jump about a foot in 
the air — several people behind him screamed. 
“What the — ?” 
He gasped. So did the people around him. About twenty ghosts 
had just streamed through the back wall. Pearly-white and slightly 
transparent, they glided across the room talking to one another and 
hardly glancing at the first years. They seemed to be arguing. What 
looked like a fat little monk was saying: “Forgive and forget, I say, 
we ought to give him a second chance —” 
“My dear Friar, haven’t we given Peeves all the chances he deserves? He gives us all a bad name and you know, he’s not really 
even a ghost — I say, what are you all doing here?” 
A ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the first 
years. 
CHAPTER SEVEN 
 116 
Nobody answered. 
“New students!” said the Fat Friar, smiling around at them. 
“About to be Sorted, I suppose?” 
A few people nodded mutely. 
“Hope to see you in Hufflepuff!” said the Friar. “My old House, 
you know.” 
“Move along now,” said a sharp voice. “The Sorting Ceremony’s 
about to start.” 
Professor McGonagall had returned. One by one, the ghosts 
floated away through the opposite wall. 
“Now, form a line,” Professor McGonagall told the first years, 
“and follow me.” 
Feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, Harry got 
into line behind a boy with sandy hair, with Ron behind him, and 
they walked out of the chamber, back across the hall, and through 
a pair of double doors into the Great Hall. 
Harry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid 
place. It was lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were 
floating in midair over four long tables, where the rest of the students were sitting. These tables were laid with glittering golden 
plates and goblets. At the top of the hall was another long table 
where the teachers were sitting. Professor McGonagall led the first 
years up here, so that they came to a halt in a line facing the other 
students, with the teachers behind them. The hundreds of faces 
staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the flickering candlelight. Dotted here and there among the students, the ghosts shone 
misty silver. Mainly to avoid all the staring eyes, Harry looked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars. He heard 
THE SORTING HAT 
 117 
Hermione whisper, “It’s bewitched to look like the sky outside. I 
read about it in Hogwarts, A History.” 
It was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all, and that the 
Great Hall didn’t simply open on to the heavens. 
Harry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall 
silently placed a four-legged stool in front of the first years. On top 
of the stool she put a pointed wizard’s hat. This hat was patched 
and frayed and extremely dirty. Aunt Petunia wouldn’t have let it in 
the house. 
Maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it, Harry thought 
wildly, that seemed the sort of thing — noticing that everyone in 
the hall was now staring at the hat, he stared at it, too. For a few 
seconds, there was complete silence. Then the hat twitched. A rip 
near the brim opened wide like a mouth — and the hat began to 
sing: 
“Oh, you may not think I’m pretty, 
But don’t judge on what you see, 
I’ll eat myself if you can find 
A smarter hat than me. 
You can keep your bowlers black, 
Your top hats sleek and tall, 
For I’m the Hogwarts Sorting Hat 
And I can cap them all. 
There’s nothing hidden in your head 
The Sorting Hat can’t see, 
So try me on and I will tell you 
Where you ought to be. 
CHAPTER SEVEN 
 118 
You might belong in Gryffindor, 
Where dwell the brave at heart, 
Their daring, nerve, and chivalry 
Set Gryffindors apart; 
You might belong in Hufflepuff, 
Where they are just and loyal, 
Those patient Hufflepuffs are true 
And unafraid of toil; 
Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw, 
If you’ve a ready mind, 
Where those of wit and learning, 
Will always find their kind; 
Or perhaps in Slytherin 
You’ll make your real friends, 
Those cunning folk use any means 
To achieve their ends. 
So put me on! Don’t be afraid!
And don’t get in a flap!
You’re in safe hands (though I have none) 
For I’m a Thinking Cap!” 
The whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song. It 
bowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still again. 
“So we’ve just got to try on the hat!” Ron whispered to Harry. 
“I’ll kill Fred, he was going on about wrestling a troll.” 
Harry smiled weakly. Yes, trying on the hat was a lot better than 
having to do a spell, but he did wish they could have tried it on 
without everyone watching. The hat seemed to be asking rather a 
THE SORTING HAT 
 119 
lot; Harry didn’t feel brave or quick-witted or any of it at the moment. If only the hat had mentioned a House for people who felt a 
bit queasy, that would have been the one for him. 
Professor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll 
of parchment. 
“When I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the 
stool to be sorted,” she said. “Abbott, Hannah!” 
A pink-faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line, put 
on the hat, which fell right down over her eyes, and sat down. A 
moment’s pause — 
“HUFFLEPUFF!” shouted the hat. 
The table on the right cheered and clapped as Hannah went to 
sit down at the Hufflepuff table. Harry saw the ghost of the Fat 
Friar waving merrily at her. 
“Bones, Susan!” 
“HUFFLEPUFF!” shouted the hat again, and Susan scuttled off 
to sit next to Hannah. 
“Boot, Terry!” 
“RAVENCLAW!” 
The table second from the left clapped this time; several Ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with Terry as he joined them. 
“Brocklehurst, Mandy” went to Ravenclaw too, but “Brown, 
Lavender” became the first new Gryffindor, and the table on the far 
left exploded with cheers; Harry could see Ron’s twin brothers catcalling. 
“Bulstrode, Millicent” then became a Slytherin. Perhaps it was 
Harry’s imagination, after all he’d heard about Slytherin, but he 
thought they looked like an unpleasant lot. 
CHAPTER SEVEN 
 120 
He was starting to feel definitely sick now. He remembered being picked for teams during gym at his old school. He had always 
been last to be chosen, not because he was no good, but because no 
one wanted Dudley to think they liked him. 
“Finch-Fletchley, Justin!” 
“HUFFLEPUFF!” 
Sometimes, Harry noticed, the hat shouted out the House at 
once, but at others it took a little while to decide. “Finnigan, Seamus,” the sandy-haired boy next to Harry in the line, sat on the 
stool for almost a whole minute before the hat declared him a 
Gryffindor. 
“Granger, Hermione!” 
Hermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on 
her head. 
“GRYFFINDOR!” shouted the hat. Ron groaned. 
A horrible thought struck Harry, as horrible thoughts always do 
when you’re very nervous. What if he wasn’t chosen at all? What if 
he just sat there with the hat over his eyes for ages, until Professor 
McGonagall jerked it off his head and said there had obviously 
been a mistake and he’d better get back on the train? 
When Neville Longbottom, the boy who kept losing his toad, 
was called, he fell over on his way to the stool. The hat took a 
long time to decide with Neville. When it finally shouted, 
“GRYFFINDOR,” Neville ran off still wearing it, and had to jog 
back amid gales of laughter to give it to “MacDougal, Morag.” 
Malfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got 
his wish at once: the hat had barely touched his head when it 
screamed, “SLYTHERIN!” 
THE SORTING HAT 
 121 
Malfoy went to join his friends Crabbe and Goyle, looking 
pleased with himself. 
There weren’t many people left now. 
“Moon” . . . , “Nott” . . . , “Parkinson” . . . , then a pair of twin 
girls, “Patil” and “Patil” . . . , then “Perks, Sally-Anne” . . . , and 
then, at last — 
“Potter, Harry!” 
As Harry stepped forward, whispers suddenly broke out like little hissing fires all over the hall. 
“Potter, did she say?” 
“The Harry Potter?” 
The last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes 
was the hall full of people craning to get a good look at him. Next 
second he was looking at the black inside of the hat. He waited. 
“Hmm,” said a small voice in his ear. “Difficult. Very difficult. 
Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind either. There’s talent, oh 
my goodness, yes — and a nice thirst to prove yourself, now that’s 
interesting. . . . So where shall I put you?” 
Harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, Not Slytherin, 
not Slytherin.
“Not Slytherin, eh?” said the small voice. “Are you sure? You 
could be great, you know, it’s all here in your head, and Slytherin 
will help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that — no? 
Well, if you’re sure — better be GRYFFINDOR!” 
Harry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall. He 
took off the hat and walked shakily toward the Gryffindor table. 
He was so relieved to have been chosen and not put in Slytherin, he 
hardly noticed that he was getting the loudest cheer yet. Percy the 
CHAPTER SEVEN 
 122 
Prefect got up and shook his hand vigorously, while the Weasley 
twins yelled, “We got Potter! We got Potter!” Harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff he’d seen earlier. The ghost patted his 
arm, giving Harry the sudden, horrible feeling he’d just plunged it 
into a bucket of ice-cold water. 
He could see the High Table properly now. At the end nearest 
him sat Hagrid, who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up. 
Harry grinned back. And there, in the center of the High Table, in 
a large gold chair, sat Albus Dumbledore. Harry recognized him at 
once from the card he’d gotten out of the Chocolate Frog on the 
train. Dumbledore’s silver hair was the only thing in the whole hall 
that shone as brightly as the ghosts. Harry spotted Professor Quirrell, too, the nervous young man from the Leaky Cauldron. He was 
looking very peculiar in a large purple turban. 
And now there were only four people left to be sorted. “Thomas, 
Dean,” a Black boy even taller than Ron, joined Harry at the 
Gryffindor table. “Turpin, Lisa,” became a Ravenclaw and then it 
was Ron’s turn. He was pale green by now. Harry crossed his fingers under the table and a second later the hat had shouted, 
“GRYFFINDOR!” 
Harry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed into the 
chair next to him. 
“Well done, Ron, excellent,” said Percy Weasley pompously 
across Harry as “Zabini, Blaise,” was made a Slytherin. Professor 
McGonagall rolled up her scroll and took the Sorting Hat away. 
Harry looked down at his empty gold plate. He had only just 
realized how hungry he was. The pumpkin pasties seemed ages 
ago. 
THE SORTING HAT 
 123 
Albus Dumbledore had gotten to his feet. He was beaming at 
the students, his arms opened wide, as if nothing could have 
pleased him more than to see them all there. 
“Welcome!” he said. “Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts! Before we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few words. And 
here they are: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak! 
“Thank you!” 
He sat back down. Everybody clapped and cheered. Harry didn’t 
know whether to laugh or not. 
“Is he — a bit mad?” he asked Percy uncertainly. 
“Mad?” said Percy airily. “He’s a genius! Best wizard in the 
world! But he is a bit mad, yes. Potatoes, Harry?” 
Harry’s mouth fell open. The dishes in front of him were now 
piled with food. He had never seen so many things he liked to eat 
on one table: roast beef, roast chicken, pork chops and lamb chops, 
sausages, bacon and steak, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes, fries, 
Yorkshire pudding, peas, carrots, gravy, ketchup, and, for some 
strange reason, peppermint humbugs. 
The Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but he’d never 
been allowed to eat as much as he liked. Dudley had always taken 
anything that Harry really wanted, even if it made him sick. Harry 
piled his plate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and 
began to eat. It was all delicious. 
“That does look good,” said the ghost in the ruff sadly, watching 
Harry cut up his steak. 
“Can’t you — ?” 
“I haven’t eaten for nearly five hundred years,” said the ghost. “I 
don’t need to, of course, but one does miss it. I don’t think I’ve in- 
CHAPTER SEVEN 
 124 
troduced myself? Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington at your service. Resident ghost of Gryffindor Tower.” 
“I know who you are!” said Ron suddenly. “My brothers told me 
about you — you’re Nearly Headless Nick!” 
“I would prefer you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy —” the 
ghost began stiffly, but sandy-haired Seamus Finnigan interrupted. 
“Nearly Headless? How can you be nearly headless?” 
Sir Nicholas looked extremely miffed, as if their little chat wasn’t 
going at all the way he wanted. 
“Like this,” he said irritably. He seized his left ear and pulled. His 
whole head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was 
on a hinge. Someone had obviously tried to behead him, but not 
done it properly. Looking pleased at the stunned looks on their 
faces, Nearly Headless Nick flipped his head back onto his neck, 
coughed, and said, “So — new Gryffindors! I hope you’re going to 
help us win the House Championship this year? Gryffindors have 
never gone so long without winning. Slytherins have got the cup six 
years in a row! The Bloody Baron’s becoming almost unbearable — he’s the Slytherin ghost.” 
Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost 
sitting there, with blank staring eyes, a gaunt face, and robes stained 
with silver blood. He was right next to Malfoy who, Harry was 
pleased to see, didn’t look too pleased with the seating arrangements. 
“How did he get covered in blood?” asked Seamus with great interest. 
“I’ve never asked,” said Nearly Headless Nick delicately. 
When everyone had eaten as much as they could, the remains of 
the food faded from the plates, leaving them sparkling clean as be-

 125 
fore. A moment later the desserts appeared. Blocks of ice cream in 
every flavor you could think of, apple pies, treacle tarts, chocolate 
éclairs and jam doughnuts, trifle, strawberries, Jell-O, rice pudding . . . 
As Harry helped himself to a treacle tart, the talk turned to their 
families. 
“I’m half-and-half,” said Seamus. “Me dad’s a Muggle. Mom 
didn’t tell him she was a witch ’til after they were married. Bit of a 
nasty shock for him.” 
The others laughed. 
“What about you, Neville?” said Ron. 
“Well, my gran brought me up and she’s a witch,” said Neville, 
“but the family thought I was all-Muggle for ages. My Great Uncle 
Algie kept trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic 
out of me — he pushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once, I 
nearly drowned — but nothing happened until I was eight. Great 
Uncle Algie came round for dinner, and he was hanging me out of 
an upstairs window by the ankles when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let go. But I bounced — 
all the way down the garden and into the road. They were all really 
pleased, Gran was crying, she was so happy. And you should have 
seen their faces when I got in here — they thought I might not be 
magic enough to come, you see. Great Uncle Algie was so pleased 
he bought me my toad.” 
On Harry’s other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking about lessons (“I do hope they start right away, there’s so much 
to learn, I’m particularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, 
turning something into something else, of course, it’s supposed to 
CHAPTER SEVEN 
 126 
be very difficult —”; “You’ll be starting small, just matches into 
needles and that sort of thing —”). 
Harry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy, looked up at 
the High Table again. Hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet. 
Professor McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore. Professor Quirrell, in his absurd turban, was talking to a teacher with 
greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skin. 
It happened very suddenly. The hook-nosed teacher looked past 
Quirrell’s turban straight into Harry’s eyes — and a sharp, hot pain 
shot across the scar on Harry’s forehead. 
“Ouch!” Harry clapped a hand to his head. 
“What is it?” asked Percy. 
“N-nothing.” 
The pain had gone as quickly as it had come. Harder to shake off 
was the feeling Harry had gotten from the teachers look — a feeling that he didn’t like Harry at all. 
“Who’s that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?” he asked 
Percy. 
“Oh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonder he’s looking so nervous, that’s Professor Snape. He teaches Potions, but he 
doesn’t want to — everyone knows he’s after Quirrell’s job. Knows 
an awful lot about the Dark Arts, Snape.” 
Harry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn’t look at him 
again. 
At last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Dumbledore 
got to his feet again. The hall fell silent. 
“Ahem — just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered. I have a few start-of-term notices to give you. 
THE SORTING HAT 
 127 
“First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils. And a few of our older students would do well to 
remember that as well.” 
Dumbledore’s twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the 
Weasley twins. 
“I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind 
you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors. 
“Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term. 
Anyone interested in playing for their House teams should contact 
Madam Hooch. 
“And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third-floor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does 
not wish to die a very painful death.” 
Harry laughed, but he was one of the few who did. 
“He’s not serious?” he muttered to Percy. 
“Must be,” said Percy, frowning at Dumbledore. “It’s odd, 
because he usually gives us a reason why we’re not allowed to go 
somewhere — the forest’s full of dangerous beasts, everyone knows 
that. I do think he might have told us prefects, at least.” 
“And now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school song!” 
cried Dumbledore. Harry noticed that the other teachers’ smiles 
had become rather fixed. 
Dumbledore gave his wand a little flick, as if he was trying to get 
a fly off the end, and a long golden ribbon flew out of it, which rose 
high above the tables and twisted itself, snakelike, into words. 
“Everyone pick their favorite tune,” said Dumbledore, “and off 
we go!” 
CHAPTER SEVEN 
 128 
And the school bellowed: 
“Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts, 
Teach us something please, 
Whether we be old and bald 
Or young with scabby knees, 
Our heads could do with filling 
With some interesting stuff, 
For now they’re bare and full of air, 
Dead flies and bits of fluff, 
So teach us things worth knowing, 
Bring back what we’ve forgot, 
Just do your best, we’ll do the rest, 
And learn until our brains all rot.” 
Everybody finished the song at different times. At last, only the 
Weasley twins were left singing along to a very slow funeral march. 
Dumbledore conducted their last few lines with his wand and 
when they had finished, he was one of those who clapped loudest. 
“Ah, music,” he said, wiping his eyes. “A magic beyond all we do 
here! And now, bedtime. Off you trot!” 
The Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the chattering 
crowds, out of the Great Hall, and up the marble staircase. Harry’s 
legs were like lead again, but only because he was so tired and full 
of food. He was too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in 
the portraits along the corridors whispered and pointed as they 
passed, or that twice Percy led them through doorways hidden behind sliding panels and hanging tapestries. They climbed more 
THE SORTING HAT 
 129 
staircases, yawning and dragging their feet, and Harry was just 
wondering how much farther they had to go when they came to a 
sudden halt. 
A bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of them, 
and as Percy took a step toward them they started throwing themselves at him. 
“Peeves,” Percy whispered to the first years. “A poltergeist.” He 
raised his voice, “Peeves — show yourself.” 
A loud, rude sound, like the air being let out of a balloon, answered. 
“Do you want me to go to the Bloody Baron?” 
There was a pop, and a little man with wicked, dark eyes and a 
wide mouth appeared, floating cross-legged in the air, clutching the 
walking sticks. 
“Oooooooh!” he said, with an evil cackle. “Ickle Firsties! What 
fun!” 
He swooped suddenly at them. They all ducked. 
“Go away, Peeves, or the Baron’ll hear about this, I mean it!” 
barked Percy. 
Peeves stuck out his tongue and vanished, dropping the walking 
sticks on Neville’s head. They heard him zooming away, rattling 
coats of armor as he passed. 
“You want to watch out for Peeves,” said Percy, as they set off 
again. “The Bloody Baron’s the only one who can control him, he 
won’t even listen to us prefects. Here we are.” 
At the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat 
woman in a pink silk dress. 
“Password?” she said. 
CHAPTER SEVEN 
 130 
“Caput Draconis,” said Percy, and the portrait swung forward to 
reveal a round hole in the wall. They all scrambled through it — 
Neville needed a leg up — and found themselves in the Gryffindor 
common room, a cozy, round room full of squashy armchairs. 
Percy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and 
the boys through another. At the top of a spiral staircase — they 
were obviously in one of the towers — they found their beds at 
last: five four-posters hung with deep red, velvet curtains. Their 
trunks had already been brought up. Too tired to talk much, they 
pulled on their pajamas and fell into bed. 
“Great food, isn’t it?” Ron muttered to Harry through the hangings. “Get off, Scabbers! He’s chewing my sheets.” 
Harry was going to ask Ron if he’d had any of the treacle tart, 
but he fell asleep almost at once. 
Perhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much, because he had a very 
strange dream. He was wearing Professor Quirrell’s turban, which 
kept talking to him, telling him he must transfer to Slytherin at 
once, because it was his destiny. Harry told the turban he didn’t 
want to be in Slytherin; it got heavier and heavier; he tried to pull 
it off but it tightened painfully — and there was Malfoy, laughing 
at him as he struggled with it — then Malfoy turned into the 
hook-nosed teacher, Snape, whose laugh became high and cold — 
there was a burst of green light and Harry woke, sweating and 
shaking. 
He rolled over and fell asleep again, and when he woke next day, 
he didn’t remember the dream at all.

here, look.” 
“Where?” 
“Next to the tall kid with the red hair.” 
“Wearing the glasses?” 
“Did you see his face?” 
“Did you see his scar?” 
Whispers followed Harry from the moment he left his dormitory the next day. People lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look at him, or doubled back to pass him in the 
corridors again, staring. Harry wished they wouldn’t, because he 
was trying to concentrate on finding his way to classes. 
There were a hundred and forty-two staircases at Hogwarts: 
wide, sweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; some that led somewhere different on a Friday; some with a vanishing step halfway up 
that you had to remember to jump. Then there were doors that 
T 
CHAPTER EIGHT 
 132 
wouldn’t open unless you asked politely, or tickled them in exactly 
the right place, and doors that weren’t really doors at all, but solid 
walls just pretending. It was also very hard to remember where anything was, because it all seemed to move around a lot. The people 
in the portraits kept going to visit each other, and Harry was sure 
the coats of armor could walk. 
The ghosts didn’t help, either. It was always a nasty shock when 
one of them glided suddenly through a door you were trying 
to open. Nearly Headless Nick was always happy to point new 
Gryffindors in the right direction, but Peeves the Poltergeist was 
worth two locked doors and a trick staircase if you met him when 
you were late for class. He would drop wastepaper baskets on your 
head, pull rugs from under your feet, pelt you with bits of chalk, or 
sneak up behind you, invisible, grab your nose, and screech, “GOT 
YOUR CONK!” 
Even worse than Peeves, if that was possible, was the caretaker, 
Argus Filch. Harry and Ron managed to get on the wrong side of 
him on their very first morning. Filch found them trying to force 
their way through a door that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to the out-of-bounds corridor on the third floor. He 
wouldn’t believe they were lost, was sure they were trying to break 
into it on purpose, and was threatening to lock them in the 
dungeons when they were rescued by Professor Quirrell, who was 
passing. 
Filch owned a cat called Mrs. Norris, a scrawny, dust-colored 
creature with bulging, lamplike eyes just like Filch’s. She patrolled 
the corridors alone. Break a rule in front of her, put just one toe out 
of line, and she’d whisk off for Filch, who’d appear, wheezing, two 
THE POTIONS MASTER 
 133 
seconds later. Filch knew the secret passageways of the school better than anyone (except perhaps the Weasley twins) and could pop 
up as suddenly as any of the ghosts. The students all hated him, 
and it was the dearest ambition of many to give Mrs. Norris a good 
kick. 
And then, once you had managed to find them, there were the 
classes themselves. There was a lot more to magic, as Harry quickly 
found out, than waving your wand and saying a few funny words. 
They had to study the night skies through their telescopes every 
Wednesday at midnight and learn the names of different stars and 
the movements of the planets. Three times a week they went out to 
the greenhouses behind the castle to study Herbology, with a 
dumpy little witch called Professor Sprout, where they learned how 
to take care of all the strange plants and fungi, and found out what 
they were used for. 
Easily the most boring class was History of Magic, which was 
the only one taught by a ghost. Professor Binns had been very old 
indeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fire and 
got up next morning to teach, leaving his body behind him. Binns 
droned on and on while they scribbled down names and dates, and 
got Emeric the Evil and Uric the Oddball mixed up. 
Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was a tiny little wizard 
who had to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk. At the start 
of their first class he took the roll call, and when he reached Harry’s 
name he gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight. 
Professor McGonagall was again different. Harry had been quite 
right to think she wasn’t a teacher to cross. Strict and clever, she gave 
them a talking-to the moment they sat down in her first class. 
CHAPTER EIGHT 
 134 
“Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous 
magic you will learn at Hogwarts,” she said. “Anyone messing 
around in my class will leave and not come back. You have been 
warned.” 
Then she changed her desk into a pig and back again. They were 
all very impressed and couldn’t wait to get started, but soon realized 
they weren’t going to be changing the furniture into animals for a 
long time. After taking a lot of complicated notes, they were each 
given a match and started trying to turn it into a needle. By the end 
of the lesson, only Hermione Granger had made any difference to 
her match; Professor McGonagall showed the class how it had gone 
all silver and pointy and gave Hermione a rare smile. 
The class everyone had really been looking forward to was Defense Against the Dark Arts, but Quirrell’s lessons turned out to be 
a bit of a joke. His classroom smelled strongly of garlic, which 
everyone said was to ward off a vampire he’d met in Romania and 
was afraid would be coming back to get him one of these days. His 
turban, he told them, had been given to him by an African prince 
as a thank-you for getting rid of a troublesome zombie, but they 
weren’t sure they believed this story. For one thing, when Seamus 
Finnigan asked eagerly to hear how Quirrell had fought off the 
zombie, Quirrell went pink and started talking about the weather; 
for another, they had noticed that a funny smell hung around the 
turban, and the Weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed full of 
garlic as well, so that Quirrell was protected wherever he went. 
Harry was very relieved to find out that he wasn’t miles behind 
everyone else. Lots of people had come from Muggle families and, 
like him, hadn’t had any idea that they were witches and wizards. 
THE POTIONS MASTER 
 135 
There was so much to learn that even people like Ron didn’t have 
much of a head start. 
Friday was an important day for Harry and Ron. They finally 
managed to find their way down to the Great Hall for breakfast 
without getting lost once. 
“What have we got today?” Harry asked Ron as he poured sugar 
on his porridge. 
“Double Potions with the Slytherins,” said Ron. “Snape’s Head 
of Slytherin House. They say he always favors them — we’ll be able 
to see if it’s true.” 
“Wish McGonagall favored us,” said Harry. Professor McGonagall was head of Gryffindor House, but it hadn’t stopped her from 
giving them a huge pile of homework the day before. 
Just then, the mail arrived. Harry had gotten used to this by 
now, but it had given him a bit of a shock on the first morning, 
when about a hundred owls had suddenly streamed into the Great 
Hall during breakfast, circling the tables until they saw their owners, and dropping letters and packages onto their laps. 
Hedwig hadn’t brought Harry anything so far. She sometimes 
flew in to nibble his ear and have a bit of toast before going off to 
sleep in the owlery with the other school owls. This morning, however, she fluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar 
bowl and dropped a note onto Harry’s plate. Harry tore it open at 
once. It said, in a very untidy scrawl: 
Dear Harry, 
I know you get Friday afternoons off so would you like 
to come and have a cup of tea with me around three? 
CHAPTER EIGHT 
 136 
I want to hear all about your first week. Send us an 
answer back with Hedwig. 
Hagrid 
Harry borrowed Ron’s quill, scribbled Yes, please, see you later on 
the back of the note, and sent Hedwig off again. 
It was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward to, 
because the Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that 
had happened to him so far. 
At the start-of-term banquet, Harry had gotten the idea that 
Professor Snape disliked him. By the end of the first Potions lesson, 
he knew he’d been wrong. Snape didn’t dislike Harry — he hated 
him. 
Potions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons. It was 
colder here than up in the main castle, and would have been quite 
creepy enough without the pickled animals floating in glass jars all 
around the walls. 
Snape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the roll call, and 
like Flitwick, he paused at Harry’s name. 
“Ah, yes,” he said softly, “Harry Potter. Our new — celebrity.” 
Draco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle sniggered behind their hands. Snape finished calling the names and looked up 
at the class. His eyes were black like Hagrid’s, but they had none of 
Hagrid’s warmth. They were cold and empty and made you think 
of dark tunnels. 
“You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potionmaking,” he began. He spoke in barely more than a whisper, but 
they caught every word — like Professor McGonagall, Snape had 
THE POTIONS MASTER 
 137 
the gift of keeping a class silent without effort. “As there is little 
foolish wand-waving here, many of you will hardly believe this is 
magic. I don’t expect you will really understand the beauty of the 
softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate 
power of liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching the 
mind, ensnaring the senses. . . . I can teach you how to bottle fame, 
brew glory, even stopper death — if you aren’t as big a bunch of 
dunderheads as I usually have to teach.” 
More silence followed this little speech. Harry and Ron exchanged looks with raised eyebrows. Hermione Granger was on the 
edge of her seat and looked desperate to start proving that she 
wasn’t a dunderhead. 
“Potter!” said Snape suddenly. “What would I get if I added 
powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?” 
Powdered root of what to an infusion of what? Harry glanced at 
Ron, who looked as stumped as he was; Hermione’s hand had shot 
into the air. 
“I don’t know, sir,” said Harry. 
Snape’s lips curled into a sneer. 
“Tut, tut — fame clearly isn’t everything.” 
He ignored Hermione’s hand. 
“Let’s try again. Potter, where would you look if I told you to 
find me a bezoar?” 
Hermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go 
without her leaving her seat, but Harry didn’t have the faintest idea 
what a bezoar was. He tried not to look at Malfoy, Crabbe, and 
Goyle, who were shaking with laughter. 
“I don’t know, sir.” 
CHAPTER EIGHT 
 138 
“Thought you wouldn’t open a book before coming, eh, Potter?” 
Harry forced himself to keep looking straight into those cold 
eyes. He had looked through his books at the Dursleys’, but did 
Snape expect him to remember everything in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi? 
Snape was still ignoring Hermione’s quivering hand. 
“What is the difference, Potter, between monkshood and wolfsbane?” 
At this, Hermione stood up, her hand stretching toward the 
dungeon ceiling. 
“I don’t know,” said Harry quietly. “I think Hermione does, 
though, why don’t you try her?” 
A few people laughed; Harry caught Seamus’s eye, and Seamus 
winked. Snape, however, was not pleased. 
“Sit down,” he snapped at Hermione. “For your information, 
Potter, asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the Draught of Living Death. A bezoar is a stone 
taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most 
poisons. As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same plant, 
which also goes by the name of aconite. Well? Why aren’t you all 
copying that down?” 
There was a sudden rummaging for quills and parchment. Over 
the noise, Snape said, “And a point will be taken from Gryffindor 
House for your cheek, Potter.” 
Things didn’t improve for the Gryffindors as the Potions lesson 
continued. Snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing up 
a simple potion to cure boils. He swept around in his long black 
cloak, watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs, 
THE POTIONS MASTER 
 139 
criticizing almost everyone except Malfoy, whom he seemed to 
like. He was just telling everyone to look at the perfect way Malfoy 
had stewed his horned slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and 
a loud hissing filled the dungeon. Neville had somehow managed 
to melt Seamus’s cauldron into a twisted blob, and their potion was 
seeping across the stone floor, burning holes in people’s shoes. 
Within seconds, the whole class was standing on their stools while 
Neville, who had been drenched in the potion when the cauldron 
collapsed, moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all over his 
arms and legs. 
“Idiot boy!” snarled Snape, clearing the spilled potion away with 
one wave of his wand. “I suppose you added the porcupine quills 
before taking the cauldron off the fire?” 
Neville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his nose. 
“Take him up to the hospital wing,” Snape spat at Seamus. Then 
he rounded on Harry and Ron, who had been working next to 
Neville. 
“You — Potter — why didn’t you tell him not to add the quills? 
Thought he’d make you look good if he got it wrong, did you? 
That’s another point you’ve lost for Gryffindor.” 
This was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to argue, but 
Ron kicked him behind their cauldron. 
“Don’t push it,” he muttered, “I’ve heard Snape can turn very 
nasty.” 
As they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later, 
Harry’s mind was racing and his spirits were low. He’d lost two 
points for Gryffindor in his very first week — why did Snape hate 
him so much? 
CHAPTER EIGHT 
 140 
“Cheer up,” said Ron, “Snape’s always taking points off Fred and 
George. Can I come and meet Hagrid with you?” 
At five to three they left the castle and made their way across the 
grounds. Hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the 
forbidden forest. A crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside 
the front door. 
When Harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from inside and several booming barks. Then Hagrid’s voice rang out, saying, “Back, Fang — back.” 
Hagrid’s big, hairy face appeared in the crack as he pulled the 
door open. 
“Hang on,” he said. “Back, Fang.” 
He let them in, struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an 
enormous black boarhound. 
There was only one room inside. Hams and pheasants were 
hanging from the ceiling, a copper kettle was boiling on the open 
fire, and in the corner stood a massive bed with a patchwork quilt 
over it. 
“Make yerselves at home,” said Hagrid, letting go of Fang, who 
bounded straight at Ron and started licking his ears. Like Hagrid, 
Fang was clearly not as fierce as he looked. 
“This is Ron,” Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring boiling water into a large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate. 
“Another Weasley, eh?” said Hagrid, glancing at Ron’s freckles. 
“I spent half me life chasin’ yer twin brothers away from the forest.” 
The rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost 
broke their teeth, but Harry and Ron pretended to be enjoying 
them as they told Hagrid all about their first lessons. Fang rested 
his head on Harry’s knee and drooled all over his robes. 
THE POTIONS MASTER 
 141 
Harry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call Filch “that old 
git’’ 
“An’ as fer that cat, Mrs. Norris, I’d like ter introduce her to 
Fang sometime. D’yeh know, every time I go up ter the school, she 
follows me everywhere? Can’t get rid of her — Filch puts her up 
to it.” 
Harry told Hagrid about Snape’s lesson. Hagrid, like Ron, told 
Harry not to worry about it, that Snape liked hardly any of the students. 
“But he seemed to really hate me.” 
“Rubbish!” said Hagrid. “Why should he?” 
Yet Harry couldn’t help thinking that Hagrid didn’t quite meet 
his eyes when he said that. 
“How’s yer brother Charlie?” Hagrid asked Ron. “I liked him a 
lot — great with animals.” 
Harry wondered if Hagrid had changed the subject on purpose. 
While Ron told Hagrid all about Charlie’s work with dragons, 
Harry picked up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under 
the tea cozy. It was a cutting from the Daily Prophet: 
GRINGOTTS BREAK-IN LATEST 
Investigations continue into the break-in at 
Gringotts on 31 July, widely believed to be the 
work of Dark wizards or witches unknown. 
Gringotts goblins today insisted that nothing 
had been taken. The vault that was searched had in 
fact been emptied the same day. 
“But we’re not telling you what was in there, so 
keep your noses out if you know what’s good 
CHAPTER EIGHT 
 142 
for you,” said a Gringotts spokesgoblin this afternoon. 
Harry remembered Ron telling him on the train that someone had 
tried to rob Gringotts, but Ron hadn’t mentioned the date. 
“Hagrid!” said Harry, “that Gringotts break-in happened on my 
birthday! It might’ve been happening while we were there!” 
There was no doubt about it, Hagrid definitely didn’t meet 
Harry’s eyes this time. He grunted and offered him another rock 
cake. Harry read the story again. The vault that was searched had in 
fact been emptied earlier that same day. Hagrid had emptied vault 
seven hundred and thirteen, if you could call it emptying, taking out 
that grubby little package. Had that been what the thieves were 
looking for? 
As Harry and Ron walked back to the castle for dinner, their 
pockets weighed down with rock cakes they’d been too polite to 
refuse, Harry thought that none of the lessons he’d had so far had 
given him as much to think about as tea with Hagrid. Had Hagrid 
collected that package just in time? Where was it now? And did 
Hagrid know something about Snape that he didn’t want to tell 
Harry? 
C H A P T E R N I N E

THE MIDNIGHT DUEL 
arry had never believed he would meet a boy he hated 
more than Dudley, but that was before he met Draco 
Malfoy. Still, first-year Gryffindors only had Potions with the 
Slytherins, so they didn’t have to put up with Malfoy much. Or at 
least, they didn’t until they spotted a notice pinned up in the 
Gryffindor common room that made them all groan. Flying 
lessons would be starting on Thursday — and Gryffindor and 
Slytherin would be learning together. 
“Typical,” said Harry darkly. “Just what I always wanted. To 
make a fool of myself on a broomstick in front of Malfoy.” 
He had been looking forward to learning to fly more than anything else. 
“You don’t know that you’ll make a fool of yourself,” said Ron 
reasonably. “Anyway, I know Malfoy’s always going on about how 
good he is at Quidditch, but I bet that’s all talk.” 
H 
CHAPTER NINE 
 144 
Malfoy certainly did talk about flying a lot. He complained 
loudly about first years never getting on the House Quidditch 
teams and told long, boastful stories that always seemed to end 
with him narrowly escaping Muggles in helicopters. He wasn’t the 
only one, though: the way Seamus Finnigan told it, he’d spent most 
of his childhood zooming around the countryside on his broomstick. Even Ron would tell anyone who’d listen about the time he’d 
almost hit a hang glider on Charlie’s old broom. Everyone from 
wizarding families talked about Quidditch constantly. Ron had already had a big argument with Dean Thomas, who shared their 
dormitory, about soccer. Ron couldn’t see what was exciting about 
a game with only one ball where no one was allowed to fly. Harry 
had caught Ron prodding Dean’s poster of West Ham soccer team, 
trying to make the players move. 
Neville had never been on a broomstick in his life, because his 
grandmother had never let him near one. Privately, Harry felt she’d 
had good reason, because Neville managed to have an extraordinary number of accidents even with both feet on the ground. 
Hermione Granger was almost as nervous about flying as Neville 
was. This was something you couldn’t learn by heart out of a 
book — not that she hadn’t tried. At breakfast on Thursday she 
bored them all stupid with flying tips she’d gotten out of a library 
book called Quidditch Through the Ages. Neville was hanging on to 
her every word, desperate for anything that might help him hang 
on to his broomstick later, but everybody else was very pleased 
when Hermione’s lecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mail. 
Harry hadn’t had a single letter since Hagrid’s note, something 
that Malfoy had been quick to notice, of course. Malfoy’s eagle owl 
THE MIDNIGHT DUEL 
 145 
was always bringing him packages of sweets from home, which he 
opened gloatingly at the Slytherin table. 
A barn owl brought Neville a small package from his grandmother. He opened it excitedly and showed them a glass ball the 
size of a large marble, which seemed to be full of white smoke. 
“It’s a Remembrall!” he explained. “Gran knows I forget 
things — this tells you if there’s something you’ve forgotten to do. 
Look, you hold it tight like this and if it turns red — oh . . .” His 
face fell, because the Remembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet, 
“. . . you’ve forgotten something . . .” 
Neville was trying to remember what he’d forgotten when Draco 
Malfoy, who was passing the Gryffindor table, snatched the Remembrall out of his hand. 
Harry and Ron jumped to their feet. They were half hoping for 
a reason to fight Malfoy, but Professor McGonagall, who could 
spot trouble quicker than any teacher in the school, was there in a 
flash. 
“What’s going on?” 
“Malfoy’s got my Remembrall, Professor.” 
Scowling, Malfoy quickly dropped the Remembrall back on the 
table. 
“Just looking,” he said, and he sloped away with Crabbe and 
Goyle behind him. 
At three-thirty that afternoon, Harry, Ron, and the other Gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first 
flying lesson. It was a clear, breezy day, and the grass rippled under 
their feet as they marched down the sloping lawns toward a 
CHAPTER NINE 
 146 
smooth, flat lawn on the opposite side of the grounds to the forbidden forest, whose trees were swaying darkly in the distance. 
The Slytherins were already there, and so were twenty broomsticks lying in neat lines on the ground. Harry had heard Fred and 
George Weasley complain about the school brooms, saying that 
some of them started to vibrate if you flew too high, or always flew 
slightly to the left. 
Their teacher, Madam Hooch, arrived. She had short, gray hair, 
and yellow eyes like a hawk. 
“Well, what are you all waiting for?” she barked. “Everyone 
stand by a broomstick. Come on, hurry up.” 
Harry glanced down at his broom. It was old and some of the 
twigs stuck out at odd angles. 
“Stick out your right hand over your broom,” called Madam 
Hooch at the front, “and say ‘Up!’ ” 
“UP!” everyone shouted. 
Harry’s broom jumped into his hand at once, but it was one of 
the few that did. Hermione Granger’s had simply rolled over on the 
ground, and Neville’s hadn’t moved at all. Perhaps brooms, like 
horses, could tell when you were afraid, thought Harry; there was 
a quaver in Neville’s voice that said only too clearly that he wanted 
to keep his feet on the ground. 
Madam Hooch then showed them how to mount their brooms 
without sliding off the end, and walked up and down the rows correcting their grips. Harry and Ron were delighted when she told 
Malfoy he’d been doing it wrong for years. 
“Now, when I blow my whistle, you kick off from the ground, 
hard,” said Madam Hooch. “Keep your brooms steady, rise a few 
THE MIDNIGHT DUEL 
 147 
feet, and then come straight back down by leaning forward slightly. 
On my whistle — three — two —” 
But Neville, nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left on 
the ground, pushed off hard before the whistle had touched 
Madam Hooch’s lips. 
“Come back, boy!” she shouted, but Neville was rising straight 
up like a cork shot out of a bottle — twelve feet — twenty feet. 
Harry saw his scared white face look down at the ground falling 
away, saw him gasp, slip sideways off the broom and — 
WHAM — a thud and a nasty crack and Neville lay facedown 
on the grass in a heap. His broomstick was still rising higher and 
higher, and started to drift lazily toward the forbidden forest and 
out of sight. 
Madam Hooch was bending over Neville, her face as white as 
his. 
“Broken wrist,” Harry heard her mutter. “Come on, boy — it’s 
all right, up you get.” 
She turned to the rest of the class. 
“None of you is to move while I take this boy to the hospital 
wing! You leave those brooms where they are or you’ll be out of 
Hogwarts before you can say ‘Quidditch.’ Come on, dear.” 
Neville, his face tear-streaked, clutching his wrist, hobbled off 
with Madam Hooch, who had her arm around him. 
No sooner were they out of earshot than Malfoy burst into 
laughter. 
“Did you see his face, the great lump?” 
The other Slytherins joined in. 
“Shut up, Malfoy,” snapped Parvati Patil. 
CHAPTER NINE 
 148 
“Ooh, sticking up for Longbottom?” said Pansy Parkinson, a 
hard-faced Slytherin girl. “Never thought you’d like fat little crybabies, Parvati.” 
“Look!” said Malfoy, darting forward and snatching something 
out of the grass. “It’s that stupid thing Longbottom’s gran sent him.” 
The Remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it up. 
“Give that here, Malfoy,” said Harry quietly. Everyone stopped 
talking to watch. 
Malfoy smiled nastily. 
“I think I’ll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find — how 
about — up a tree?” 
“Give it here!” Harry yelled, but Malfoy had leapt onto his 
broomstick and taken off. He hadn’t been lying, he could fly well. 
Hovering level with the topmost branches of an oak he called, 
“Come and get it, Potter!” 
Harry grabbed his broom. 
“No!” shouted Hermione Granger. “Madam Hooch told us not 
to move — you’ll get us all into trouble.” 
Harry ignored her. Blood was pounding in his ears. He mounted 
the broom and kicked hard against the ground and up, up he 
soared; air rushed through his hair, and his robes whipped out behind him — and in a rush of fierce joy he realized he’d found 
something he could do without being taught — this was easy, this 
was wonderful. He pulled his broomstick up a little to take it even 
higher, and heard screams and gasps of girls back on the ground and 
an admiring whoop from Ron. 
He turned his broomstick sharply to face Malfoy in midair. Malfoy looked stunned. 
THE MIDNIGHT DUEL 
 149 
“Give it here,” Harry called, “or I’ll knock you off that broom!” 
“Oh, yeah?” said Malfoy, trying to sneer, but looking worried. 
Harry knew, somehow, what to do. He leaned forward and 
grasped the broom tightly in both hands, and it shot toward Malfoy like a javelin. Malfoy only just got out of the way in time; 
Harry made a sharp about-face and held the broom steady. A few 
people below were clapping. 
“No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck, Malfoy,” 
Harry called. 
The same thought seemed to have struck Malfoy. 
“Catch it if you can, then!” he shouted, and he threw the glass 
ball high into the air and streaked back toward the ground. 
Harry saw, as though in slow motion, the ball rise up in the air 
and then start to fall. He leaned forward and pointed his broom 
handle down — next second he was gathering speed in a steep 
dive, racing the ball — wind whistled in his ears, mingled with the 
screams of people watching — he stretched out his hand — a foot 
from the ground he caught it, just in time to pull his broom 
straight, and he toppled gently onto the grass with the Remembrall 
clutched safely in his fist. 
“HARRY POTTER!” 
His heart sank faster than he’d just dived. Professor McGonagall 
was running toward them. He got to his feet, trembling. 
“Never — in all my time at Hogwarts —” 
Professor McGonagall was almost speechless with shock, and 
her glasses flashed furiously, “— how dare you — might have broken your neck —” 
“It wasn’t his fault, Professor —” 
CHAPTER NINE 
 150 
“Be quiet, Miss Patil —” 
“But Malfoy —” 
“That’s enough, Mr. Weasley. Potter, follow me, now.” 
Harry caught sight of Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle’s triumphant 
faces as he left, walking numbly in Professor McGonagall’s wake as 
she strode toward the castle. He was going to be expelled, he just 
knew it. He wanted to say something to defend himself, but there 
seemed to be something wrong with his voice. Professor McGonagall was sweeping along without even looking at him; he had to jog 
to keep up. Now he’d done it. He hadn’t even lasted two weeks. 
He’d be packing his bags in ten minutes. What would the Dursleys 
say when he turned up on the doorstep? 
Up the front steps, up the marble staircase inside, and still Professor McGonagall didn’t say a word to him. She wrenched open 
doors and marched along corridors with Harry trotting miserably 
behind her. Maybe she was taking him to Dumbledore. He thought 
of Hagrid, expelled but allowed to stay on as gamekeeper. Perhaps 
he could be Hagrid’s assistant. His stomach twisted as he imagined 
it, watching Ron and the others becoming wizards while he 
stumped around the grounds carrying Hagrid’s bag. 
Professor McGonagall stopped outside a classroom. She opened 
the door and poked her head inside. 
“Excuse me, Professor Flitwick, could I borrow Wood for a moment?” 
Wood? thought Harry, bewildered; was Wood a cane she was going to use on him? 
But Wood turned out to be a person, a burly fifth-year boy who 
came out of Flitwick’s class looking confused. 
THE MIDNIGHT DUEL 
 151 
“Follow me, you two,” said Professor McGonagall, and they 
marched on up the corridor, Wood looking curiously at Harry. 
“In here.” 
Professor McGonagall pointed them into a classroom that was 
empty except for Peeves, who was busy writing rude words on the 
blackboard. 
“Out, Peeves!” she barked. Peeves threw the chalk into a bin, 
which clanged loudly, and he swooped out cursing. Professor 
McGonagall slammed the door behind him and turned to face the 
two boys. 
“Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood — I’ve found you a Seeker.” 
Wood’s expression changed from puzzlement to delight. 
“Are you serious, Professor?” 
“Absolutely,” said Professor McGonagall crisply. “The boy’s a 
natural. I’ve never seen anything like it. Was that your first time on 
a broomstick, Potter?” 
Harry nodded silently. He didn’t have a clue what was going on, 
but he didn’t seem to be being expelled, and some of the feeling 
started coming back to his legs. 
“He caught that thing in his hand after a fifty-foot dive,” Professor McGonagall told Wood. “Didn’t even scratch himself. Charlie 
Weasley couldn’t have done it.” 
Wood was now looking as though all his dreams had come true 
at once. 
“Ever seen a game of Quidditch, Potter?” he asked excitedly. 
“Wood’s captain of the Gryffindor team,” Professor McGonagall 
explained. 
“He’s just the build for a Seeker, too,” said Wood, now walking 
CHAPTER NINE 
 152 
around Harry and staring at him. “Light — speedy — we’ll have 
to get him a decent broom, Professor — a Nimbus Two Thousand 
or a Cleansweep Seven, I’d say.” 
“I shall speak to Professor Dumbledore and see if we can’t bend 
the first-year rule. Heaven knows, we need a better team than last 
year. Flattened in that last match by Slytherin, I couldn’t look 
Severus Snape in the face for weeks. . . .” 
Professor McGonagall peered sternly over her glasses at Harry. 
“I want to hear you’re training hard, Potter, or I may change my 
mind about punishing you.” 
Then she suddenly smiled. 
“Your father would have been proud,” she said. “He was an excellent Quidditch player himself.” 
“You’re joking.” 
It was dinnertime. Harry had just finished telling Ron what had 
happened when he’d left the grounds with Professor McGonagall. 
Ron had a piece of steak and kidney pie halfway to his mouth, but 
he’d forgotten all about it. 
“Seeker?” he said. “But first years never — you must be the 
youngest House player in about —” 
“— a century,” said Harry, shoveling pie into his mouth. He felt 
particularly hungry after the excitement of the afternoon. “Wood 
told me.” 
Ron was so amazed, so impressed, he just sat and gaped at Harry. 
“I start training next week,” said Harry. “Only don’t tell anyone, 
Wood wants to keep it a secret.” 
Fred and George Weasley now came into the hall, spotted Harry, 
and hurried over. 
THE MIDNIGHT DUEL 
 153 
“Well done,” said George in a low voice. “Wood told us. We’re 
on the team too — Beaters.” 
“I tell you, we’re going to win that Quidditch Cup for sure this 
year,” said Fred. “We haven’t won since Charlie left, but this year’s 
team is going to be brilliant. You must be good, Harry, Wood was 
almost skipping when he told us.” 
“Anyway, we’ve got to go, Lee Jordan reckons he’s found a new 
secret passageway out of the school.” 
“Bet it’s that one behind the statue of Gregory the Smarmy that 
we found in our first week. See you.” 
Fred and George had hardly disappeared when someone far less 
welcome turned up: Malfoy, flanked by Crabbe and Goyle. 
“Having a last meal, Potter? When are you getting the train back 
to the Muggles?” 
“You’re a lot braver now that you’re back on the ground and 
you’ve got your little friends with you,” said Harry coolly. There 
was of course nothing at all little about Crabbe and Goyle, but as 
the High Table was full of teachers, neither of them could do more 
than crack their knuckles and scowl. 
“I’d take you on anytime on my own,” said Malfoy. “Tonight, if 
you want. Wizard’s duel. Wands only — no contact. What’s the 
matter? Never heard of a wizard’s duel before, I suppose?” 
“Of course he has,” said Ron, wheeling around. “I’m his second, 
who’s yours?” 
Malfoy looked at Crabbe and Goyle, sizing them up. 
“Crabbe,” he said. “Midnight all right? We’ll meet you in the 
trophy room; that’s always unlocked.” 
When Malfoy had gone, Ron and Harry looked at each 
other. 
CHAPTER NINE 
 154 
“What is a wizard’s duel?” said Harry. “And what do you mean, 
you’re my second?” 
“Well, a second’s there to take over if you die,” said Ron casually, 
getting started at last on his cold pie. Catching the look on Harry’s 
face, he added quickly, “But people only die in proper duels, you 
know, with real wizards. The most you and Malfoy’ll be able to do 
is send sparks at each other. Neither of you knows enough magic to 
do any real damage. I bet he expected you to refuse, anyway.” 
“And what if I wave my wand and nothing happens?” 
“Throw it away and punch him on the nose,” Ron suggested. 
“Excuse me. 
They both looked up. It was Hermione Granger. 
“Can’t a person eat in peace in this place?” said Ron. 
Hermione ignored him and spoke to Harry. 
“I couldn’t help overhearing what you and Malfoy were 
saying —” 
“Bet you could,” Ron muttered. 
“— and you mustn’t go wandering around the school at night, 
think of the points you’ll lose Gryffindor if you’re caught, and 
you’re bound to be. It’s really very selfish of you.” 
“And it’s really none of your business,” said Harry. 
“Good-bye,” said Ron. 
All the same, it wasn’t what you’d call the perfect end to the day, 
Harry thought, as he lay awake much later listening to Dean and 
Seamus falling asleep (Neville wasn’t back from the hospital wing). 
Ron had spent all evening giving him advice such as “If he tries to 
curse you, you’d better dodge it, because I can’t remember how to 
THE MIDNIGHT DUEL 
 155 
block them.” There was a very good chance they were going to get 
caught by Filch or Mrs. Norris, and Harry felt he was pushing his 
luck, breaking another school rule today. On the other hand, Malfoy’s sneering face kept looming up out of the darkness — this was 
his big chance to beat Malfoy face-to-face. He couldn’t miss it. 
“Half-past eleven,” Ron muttered at last, “we’d better go.” 
They pulled on their bathrobes, picked up their wands, and 
crept across the tower room, down the spiral staircase, and into the 
Gryffindor common room. A few embers were still glowing in the 
fireplace, turning all the armchairs into hunched black shadows. 
They had almost reached the portrait hole when a voice spoke from 
the chair nearest them, “I can’t believe you’re going to do this, 
Harry.” 
A lamp flickered on. It was Hermione Granger, wearing a pink 
bathrobe and a frown. 
“You!” said Ron furiously. “Go back to bed!” 
“I almost told your brother,” Hermione snapped, “Percy — he’s 
a prefect, he’d put a stop to this.” 
Harry couldn’t believe anyone could be so interfering. 
“Come on,” he said to Ron. He pushed open the portrait of the 
Fat Lady and climbed through the hole. 
Hermione wasn’t going to give up that easily. She followed Ron 
through the portrait hole, hissing at them like an angry goose. 
“Don’t you care about Gryffindor, do you only care about yourselves, I don’t want Slytherin to win the House Cup, and you’ll lose 
all the points I got from Professor McGonagall for knowing about 
Switching Spells.” 
“Go away.” 
CHAPTER NINE 
 156 
“All right, but I warned you, you just remember what I said 
when you’re on the train home tomorrow, you’re so —” 
But what they were, they didn’t find out. Hermione had turned 
to the portrait of the Fat Lady to get back inside and found herself 
facing an empty painting. The Fat Lady had gone on a nighttime 
visit and Hermione was locked out of Gryffindor Tower. 
“Now what am I going to do?” she asked shrilly. 
“That’s your problem,” said Ron. “We’ve got to go, we’re going 
to be late.” 
They hadn’t even reached the end of the corridor when 
Hermione caught up with them. 
“I’m coming with you,” she said. 
“You are not.” 
“D’you think I’m going to stand out here and wait for Filch to 
catch me? If he finds all three of us I’ll tell him the truth, that I was 
trying to stop you, and you can back me up.” 
“You’ve got some nerve —” said Ron loudly. 
“Shut up, both of you!” said Harry sharply. “I heard something.” 
It was a sort of snuffling. 
“Mrs. Norris?” breathed Ron, squinting through the dark. 
It wasn’t Mrs. Norris. It was Neville. He was curled up on the 
floor, fast asleep, but jerked suddenly awake as they crept nearer. 
“Thank goodness you found me! I’ve been out here for hours, I 
couldn’t remember the new password to get in to bed.” 
“Keep your voice down, Neville. The password’s ‘Pig snout’ but 
it won’t help you now, the Fat Lady’s gone off somewhere.” 
“How’s your arm?” said Harry. 
“Fine,” said Neville, showing them. “Madam Pomfrey mended 
it in about a minute.” 
THE MIDNIGHT DUEL 
 157 
“Good — well, look, Neville, we’ve got to be somewhere, we’ll 
see you later —” 
“Don’t leave me!” said Neville, scrambling to his feet, “I don’t 
want to stay here alone, the Bloody Baron’s been past twice already.” 
Ron looked at his watch and then glared furiously at Hermione 
and Neville. 
“If either of you get us caught, I’ll never rest until I’ve learned 
that Curse of the Bogies Quirrell told us about, and used it on 
you. 
Hermione opened her mouth, perhaps to tell Ron exactly how 
to use the Curse of the Bogies, but Harry hissed at her to be quiet 
and beckoned them all forward. 
They flitted along corridors striped with bars of moonlight from 
the high windows. At every turn Harry expected to run into Filch 
or Mrs. Norris, but they were lucky. They sped up a staircase to the 
third floor and tiptoed toward the trophy room. 
Malfoy and Crabbe weren’t there yet. The crystal trophy cases 
glimmered where the moonlight caught them. Cups, shields, 
plates, and statues winked silver and gold in the darkness. They 
edged along the walls, keeping their eyes on the doors at either end 
of the room. Harry took out his wand in case Malfoy leapt in and 
started at once. The minutes crept by. 
“He’s late, maybe he’s chickened out,” Ron whispered. 
Then a noise in the next room made them jump. Harry had only 
just raised his wand when they heard someone speak — and it 
wasn’t Malfoy. 
“Sniff around, my sweet, they might be lurking in a corner.” 
It was Filch speaking to Mrs. Norris. Horror-struck, Harry 
CHAPTER NINE 
 158 
waved madly at the other three to follow him as quickly as possible; 
they scurried silently toward the door, away from Filch’s voice. 
Neville’s robes had barely whipped round the corner when they 
heard Filch enter the trophy room. 
“They’re in here somewhere,” they heard him mutter, “probably 
hiding.” 
“This way!” Harry mouthed to the others and, petrified, they 
began to creep down a long gallery full of suits of armor. They 
could hear Filch getting nearer. Neville suddenly let out a frightened squeak and broke into a run — he tripped, grabbed Ron 
around the waist, and the pair of them toppled right into a suit of 
armor. 
The clanging and crashing were enough to wake the whole 
castle. 
“RUN!” Harry yelled, and the four of them sprinted down the 
gallery, not looking back to see whether Filch was following — 
they swung around the doorpost and galloped down one corridor 
then another, Harry in the lead, without any idea where they were 
or where they were going — they ripped through a tapestry and 
found themselves in a hidden passageway, hurtled along it and 
came out near their Charms classroom, which they knew was miles 
from the trophy room. 
“I think we’ve lost him,” Harry panted, leaning against the cold 
wall and wiping his forehead. Neville was bent double, wheezing 
and spluttering. 
“I — told — you,” Hermione gasped, clutching at the stitch in 
her chest, “I — told — you.” 
“We’ve got to get back to Gryffindor Tower,” said Ron, “quickly 
as possible.” 
THE MIDNIGHT DUEL 
 159 
“Malfoy tricked you,” Hermione said to Harry. “You realize 
that, don’t you? He was never going to meet you — Filch knew 
someone was going to be in the trophy room, Malfoy must have 
tipped him off.” 
Harry thought she was probably right, but he wasn’t going to tell 
her that. 
“Let’s go.” 
It wasn’t going to be that simple. They hadn’t gone more than a 
dozen paces when a doorknob rattled and something came shooting out of a classroom in front of them. 
It was Peeves. He caught sight of them and gave a squeal of delight. 
“Shut up, Peeves — please — you’ll get us thrown out.” 
Peeves cackled. 
“Wandering around at midnight, Ickle Firsties? Tut, tut, tut. 
Naughty, naughty, you’ll get caughty.” 
“Not if you don’t give us away, Peeves, please.” 
“Should tell Filch, I should,” said Peeves in a sanity voice, but 
his eyes glittered wickedly. “It’s for your own good, you know.” 
“Get out of the way,” snapped Ron, taking a swipe at Peeves — 
this was a big mistake. 
“STUDENTS OUT OF BED!” Peeves bellowed, “STUDENTS OUT OF BED DOWN THE CHARMS CORRIDOR!” 
Ducking under Peeves, they ran for their lives, right to the end 
of the corridor where they slammed into a door — and it was 
locked. 
“This is it!” Ron moaned, as they pushed helplessly at the door, 
“We’re done for! This is the end!” 
CHAPTER NINE 
 160 
They could hear footsteps, Filch running as fast as he could 
toward Peeves’s shouts. 
“Oh, move over,” Hermione snarled. She grabbed Harry’s wand, 
tapped the lock, and whispered, “Alohomora!” 
The lock clicked and the door swung open — they piled through 
it, shut it quickly, and pressed their ears against it, listening. 
“Which way did they go, Peeves?” Filch was saying. “Quick, 
tell me.” 
“Say ‘please.’ ” 
“Don’t mess with me, Peeves, now where did they go?” 
“Shan’t say nothing if you don’t say please,” said Peeves in his annoying singsong voice. 
“All right — please.” 
“NOTHING! Ha haaa! Told you I wouldn’t say nothing if you 
didn’t say please! Ha ha! Haaaaaa!” And they heard the sound of 
Peeves whooshing away and Filch cursing in rage. 
“He thinks this door is locked,” Harry whispered. “I think we’ll 
be okay — get off, Neville!” For Neville had been tugging on the 
sleeve of Harry’s bathrobe for the last minute. “What?” 
Harry turned around — and saw, quite clearly, what. For a moment, he was sure he’d walked into a nightmare — this was too 
much, on top of everything that had happened so far. 
They weren’t in a room, as he had supposed. They were in a corridor. The forbidden corridor on the third floor. And now they 
knew why it was forbidden. 
They were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog, a 
dog that filled the whole space between ceiling and floor. It had 
three heads. Three pairs of rolling, mad eyes; three noses, twitching 
THE MIDNIGHT DUEL 
 161 
and quivering in their direction; three drooling mouths, saliva 
hanging in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs. 
It was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them, and Harry 
knew that the only reason they weren’t already dead was that their 
sudden appearance had taken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting over that, there was no mistaking what those thunderous 
growls meant. 
Harry groped for the doorknob — between Filch and death, 
he’d take Filch. 
They fell backward — Harry slammed the door shut, and they 
ran, they almost flew, back down the corridor. Filch must have hurried off to look for them somewhere else, because they didn’t see 
him anywhere, but they hardly cared — all they wanted to do was 
put as much space as possible between them and that monster. 
They didn’t stop running until they reached the portrait of the Fat 
Lady on the seventh floor. 
“Where on earth have you all been?” she asked, looking at their 
bathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed, sweaty faces. 
“Never mind that — pig snout, pig snout,” panted Harry, and 
the portrait swung forward. They scrambled into the common 
room and collapsed, trembling, into armchairs. 
It was a while before any of them said anything. Neville, indeed, 
looked as if he’d never speak again. 
“What do they think they’re doing, keeping a thing like that 
locked up in a school?” said Ron finally. “If any dog needs exercise, 
that one does.” 
Hermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back 
again. 
CHAPTER NINE 
 162 
“You don’t use your eyes, any of you, do you?” she snapped. 
“Didn’t you see what it was standing on?” 
“The floor?” Harry suggested. “I wasn’t looking at its feet, I was 
too busy with its heads.” 
“No, not the floor. It was standing on a trapdoor. It’s obviously 
guarding something.” 
She stood up, glaring at them. 
“I hope you’re pleased with yourselves. We could all have been 
killed — or worse, expelled. Now, if you don’t mind, I’m going to 
bed.” 
Ron stared after her, his mouth open. 
“No, we don’t mind,” he said. “You’d think we dragged her 
along, wouldn’t you?” 
But Hermione had given Harry something else to think about as 
he climbed back into bed. The dog was guarding something. . . . 
What had Hagrid said? Gringotts was the safest place in the 
world for something you wanted to hide — except perhaps Hogwarts. 
It looked as though Harry had found out where the grubby little package from vault seven hundred and thirteen was. 
C H A P T E R T E N

HALLOWEEN 
alfoy couldn’t believe his eyes when he saw that Harry 
and Ron were still at Hogwarts the next day, looking 
tired but perfectly cheerful. Indeed, by the next morning Harry 
and Ron thought that meeting the three-headed dog had been an 
excellent adventure, and they were quite keen to have another one. 
In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the package that 
seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and they 
spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy 
protection. 
“It’s either really valuable or really dangerous,” said Ron. 
“Or both,” said Harry. 
But as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was 
that it was about two inches long, they didn’t have much chance of 
guessing what it was without further clues. 
Neither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in 
M
CHAPTER TEN 
 164 
what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor. All Neville cared 
about was never going near the dog again. 
Hermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron, but she 
was such a bossy know-it-all that they saw this as an added bonus. 
All they really wanted now was a way of getting back at Malfoy, and 
to their great delight, just such a thing arrived in the mail about a 
week later. 
As the owls flooded into the Great Hall as usual, everyone’s attention was caught at once by a long, thin package carried by six 
large screech owls. Harry was just as interested as everyone else to 
see what was in this large parcel, and was amazed when the owls 
soared down and dropped it right in front of him, knocking his bacon to the floor. They had hardly fluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a letter on top of the parcel. 
Harry ripped open the letter first, which was lucky, because it 
said: 
DO NOT OPEN THE PARCEL AT THE TABLE. 
It contains your new Nimbus Two Thousand, but I don’t 
want everybody knowing you’ve got a broomstick or they’ll 
all want one. Oliver Wood will meet you tonight on the 
Quidditch field at seven o’clock for your first training session. 
Harry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the note to Ron 
to read. 
HALLOWEEN 
 165 
“A Nimbus Two Thousand!” Ron moaned enviously. “I’ve never 
even touched one.” 
They left the hall quickly, wanting to unwrap the broomstick in 
private before their first class, but halfway across the entrance hall 
they found the way upstairs barred by Crabbe and Goyle. Malfoy 
seized the package from Harry and felt it. 
“That’s a broomstick,” he said, throwing it back to Harry with a 
mixture of jealousy and spite on his face. “You’ll be in for it this 
time, Potter, first years aren’t allowed them.” 
Ron couldn’t resist it. 
“It’s not any old broomstick,” he said, “it’s a Nimbus Two Thousand. What did you say you’ve got at home, Malfoy, a Comet Two 
Sixty?” Ron grinned at Harry. “Comets look flashy, but they’re not 
in the same league as the Nimbus.” 
“What would you know about it, Weasley, you couldn’t afford 
half the handle,” Malfoy snapped back. “I suppose you and your 
brothers have to save up twig by twig.” 
Before Ron could answer, Professor Flitwick appeared at Malfoy’s elbow. 
“Not arguing, I hope, boys?” he squeaked. 
“Potters been sent a broomstick, Professor,” said Malfoy quickly. 
“Yes, yes, that’s right,” said Professor Flitwick, beaming at Harry. 
“Professor McGonagall told me all about the special circumstances, 
Potter. And what model is it?” 
“A Nimbus Two Thousand, sir,” said Harry, fighting not to 
laugh at the look of horror on Malfoy’s face. “And it’s really thanks 
to Malfoy here that I’ve got it,” he added. 
Harry and Ron headed upstairs, smothering their laughter at 
Malfoy’s obvious rage and confusion. 
CHAPTER TEN 
 166 
“Well, it’s true,” Harry chortled as they reached the top of the 
marble staircase, “If he hadn’t stolen Neville’s Remembrall I 
wouldn’t be on the team. . . .” 
“So I suppose you think that’s a reward for breaking rules?” came 
an angry voice from just behind them. Hermione was stomping up 
the stairs, looking disapprovingly at the package in Harry’s hand. 
“I thought you weren’t speaking to us?” said Harry. 
“Yes, don’t stop now,” said Ron, “it’s doing us so much good.” 
Hermione marched away with her nose in the air. 
Harry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that 
day. It kept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying under his bed, or straying off to the Quidditch 
field where he’d be learning to play that night. He bolted his dinner that evening without noticing what he was eating, and then 
rushed upstairs with Ron to unwrap the Nimbus Two Thousand at 
last. 
“Wow,” Ron sighed, as the broomstick rolled onto Harry’s bedspread. 
Even Harry, who knew nothing about the different brooms, 
thought it looked wonderful. Sleek and shiny, with a mahogany 
handle, it had a long tail of neat, straight twigs and Nimbus Two 
Thousand written in gold near the top. 
As seven o’clock drew nearer, Harry left the castle and set off in 
the dusk toward the Quidditch field. He’d never been inside the 
stadium before. Hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the 
field so that the spectators were high enough to see what was going 
on. At either end of the field were three golden poles with hoops on 
the end. They reminded Harry of the little plastic sticks Muggle 
HALLOWEEN 
 167 
children blew bubbles through, except that they were fifty feet 
high. 
Too eager to fly again to wait for Wood, Harry mounted his 
broomstick and kicked off from the ground. What a feeling — he 
swooped in and out of the goal posts and then sped up and down 
the field. The Nimbus Two Thousand turned wherever he wanted 
at his lightest touch. 
“Hey, Potter, come down!” 
Oliver Wood had arrived. He was carrying a large wooden crate 
under his arm. Harry landed next to him. 
“Very nice,” said Wood, his eyes glinting. “I see what McGonagall meant . . . you really are a natural. I’m just going to teach you 
the rules this evening, then you’ll be joining team practice three 
times a week.” 
He opened the crate. Inside were four different-sized balls. 
“Right,” said Wood. “Now, Quidditch is easy enough to understand, even if it’s not too easy to play. There are seven players on 
each side. Three of them are called Chasers.” 
“Three Chasers,” Harry repeated, as Wood took out a bright red 
ball about the size of a soccer ball. 
“This ball’s called the Quaffle,” said Wood. “The Chasers throw 
the Quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the 
hoops to score a goal. Ten points every time the Quaffle goes 
through one of the hoops. Follow me?” 
“The Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through the hoops to 
score,” Harry recited. “So — that’s sort of like basketball on 
broomsticks with six hoops, isn’t it?” 
“What’s basketball?” said Wood curiously. 
CHAPTER TEN 
 168 
“Never mind,” said Harry quickly. 
“Now, there’s another player on each side who’s called the 
Keeper — I’m Keeper for Gryffindor. I have to fly around our 
hoops and stop the other team from scoring.” 
“Three Chasers, one Keeper,” said Harry, who was determined 
to remember it all. “And they play with the Quaffle. Okay, got that. 
So what are they for?” He pointed at the three balls left inside the 
box. 
“I’ll show you now,” said Wood. “Take this.” 
He handed Harry a small club, a bit like a short baseball bat. 
“I’m going to show you what the Bludgers do,” Wood said. 
“These two are the Bludgers.” 
He showed Harry two identical balls, jet black and slightly 
smaller than the red Quaffle. Harry noticed that they seemed to be 
straining to escape the straps holding them inside the box. 
“Stand back,” Wood warned Harry. He bent down and freed 
one of the Bludgers. 
At once, the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted 
straight at Harry’s face. Harry swung at it with the bat to stop it 
from breaking his nose, and sent it zigzagging away into the air — 
it zoomed around their heads and then shot at Wood, who dived 
on top of it and managed to pin it to the ground. 
“See?” Wood panted, forcing the struggling Bludger back into 
the crate and strapping it down safely. “The Bludgers rocket around, 
trying to knock players off their brooms. That’s why you have two 
Beaters on each team — the Weasley twins are ours — it’s their job 
to protect their side from the Bludgers and try and knock them 
toward the other team. So — think you’ve got all that?” 
HALLOWEEN 
 169 
“Three Chasers try and score with the Quaffle; the Keeper 
guards the goal posts; the Beaters keep the Bludgers away from their 
team,” Harry reeled off. 
“Very good,” said Wood. 
“Er — have the Bludgers ever killed anyone?” Harry asked, hoping he sounded offhand. 
“Never at Hogwarts. We’ve had a couple of broken jaws but 
nothing worse than that. Now, the last member of the team is the 
Seeker. That’s you. And you don’t have to worry about the Quaffle 
or the Bludgers —” 
“— unless they crack my head open.” 
“Don’t worry, the Weasleys are more than a match for the 
Bludgers — I mean, they’re like a pair of human Bludgers themselves.” 
Wood reached into the crate and took out the fourth and last 
ball. Compared with the Quaffle and the Bludgers, it was tiny, 
about the size of a large walnut. It was bright gold and had little 
fluttering silver wings. 
“This,” said Wood, “is the Golden Snitch, and it’s the most important ball of the lot. It’s very hard to catch because it’s so fast and 
difficult to see. It’s the Seeker’s job to catch it. You’ve got to weave 
in and out of the Chasers, Beaters, Bludgers, and Quaffle to get it 
before the other team’s Seeker, because whichever Seeker catches 
the Snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points, so they 
nearly always win. That’s why Seekers get fouled so much. A game 
of Quidditch only ends when the Snitch is caught, so it can go on 
for ages — I think the record is three months, they had to keep 
bringing on substitutes so the players could get some sleep. 
CHAPTER TEN 
 170 
“Well, that’s it — any questions?” 
Harry shook his head. He understood what he had to do all 
right, it was doing it that was going to be the problem. 
“We won’t practice with the Snitch yet,” said Wood, carefully 
shutting it back inside the crate, “it’s too dark, we might lose it. 
Let’s try you out with a few of these.” 
He pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and a few 
minutes later, he and Harry were up in the air, Wood throwing the 
golf balls as hard as he could in every direction for Harry to catch. 
Harry didn’t miss a single one, and Wood was delighted. After 
half an hour, night had really fallen and they couldn’t carry on. 
“That Quidditch Cup’ll have our name on it this year,” said 
Wood happily as they trudged back up to the castle. “I wouldn’t be 
surprised if you turn out better than Charlie Weasley, and he could 
have played for England if he hadn’t gone off chasing dragons.” 
Perhaps it was because he was now so busy, what with Quidditch 
practice three evenings a week on top of all his homework, but 
Harry could hardly believe it when he realized that he’d already 
been at Hogwarts two months. The castle felt more like home than 
Privet Drive ever had. His lessons, too, were becoming more and 
more interesting now that they had mastered the basics. 
On Halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of baking pumpkin wafting through the corridors. Even better, Professor 
Flitwick announced in Charms that he thought they were ready to 
start making objects fly, something they had all been dying to try 
since they’d seen him make Neville’s toad zoom around the classroom. Professor Flitwick put the class into pairs to practice. Harry’s 
HALLOWEEN 
 171 
partner was Seamus Finnigan (which was a relief, because Neville 
had been trying to catch his eye). Ron, however, was to be working 
with Hermione Granger. It was hard to tell whether Ron or 
Hermione was angrier about this. She hadn’t spoken to either of 
them since the day Harry’s broomstick had arrived. 
“Now, don’t forget that nice wrist movement we’ve been practicing!” squeaked Professor Flitwick, perched on top of his pile of 
books as usual. “Swish and flick, remember, swish and flick. And 
saying the magic words properly is very important, too — never 
forget Wizard Baruffio, who said ‘s’ instead of ‘f’ and found himself 
on the floor with a buffalo on his chest.” 
It was very difficult. Harry and Seamus swished and flicked, but 
the feather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on 
the desktop. Seamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his 
wand and set fire to it — Harry had to put it out with his hat. 
Ron, at the next table, wasn’t having much more luck. 
“Wingardium Leviosa!” he shouted, waving his long arms like a 
windmill. 
“You’re saying it wrong,” Harry heard Hermione snap. “It’s 
Wing-gar-dium Levi-o-sa, make the ‘gar’ nice and long.” 
“You do it, then, if you’re so clever,” Ron snarled. 
Hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown, flicked her wand, 
and said, “Wingardium Leviosa!” 
Their feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet above 
their heads. 
“Oh, well done!” cried Professor Flitwick, clapping. “Everyone 
see here, Miss Granger’s done it!” 
Ron was in a very bad mood by the end of the class. 
CHAPTER TEN 
 172 
“It’s no wonder no one can stand her,” he said to Harry as they 
pushed their way into the crowded corridor, “she’s a nightmare, 
honestly.” 
Someone knocked into Harry as they hurried past him. It was 
Hermione. Harry caught a glimpse of her face — and was startled 
to see that she was in tears. 
“I think she heard you.” 
“So?” said Ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable. “She must’ve 
noticed she’s got no friends.” 
Hermione didn’t turn up for the next class and wasn’t seen all afternoon. On their way down to the Great Hall for the Halloween 
feast, Harry and Ron overheard Parvati Patil telling her friend 
Lavender that Hermione was crying in the girls’ bathroom and 
wanted to be left alone. Ron looked still more awkward at this, but 
a moment later they had entered the Great Hall, where the Halloween decorations put Hermione out of their minds. 
A thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a 
thousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds, making the candles in the pumpkins stutter. The feast appeared suddenly on the golden plates, as it had at the start-of-term banquet. 
Harry was just helping himself to a baked potato when Professor 
Quirrell came sprinting into the hall, his turban askew and terror 
on his face. Everyone stared as he reached Professor Dumbledore’s 
chair, slumped against the table, and gasped, “Troll — in the dungeons — thought you ought to know.” 
He then sank to the floor in a dead faint. 
There was an uproar. It took several purple firecrackers exploding from the end of Professor Dumbledore’s wand to bring silence. 
HALLOWEEN 
 173 
“Prefects,” he rumbled, “lead your Houses back to the dormitories immediately!” 
Percy was in his element. 
“Follow me! Stick together, first years! No need to fear the troll 
if you follow my orders! Stay close behind me, now. Make way, first 
years coming through! Excuse me, I’m a prefect!” 
“How could a troll get in?” Harry asked as they climbed the 
stairs. 
“Don’t ask me, they’re supposed to be really stupid,” said Ron. 
“Maybe Peeves let it in for a Halloween joke.” 
They passed different groups of people hurrying in different directions. As they jostled their way through a crowd of confused 
Hufflepuffs, Harry suddenly grabbed Ron’s arm. 
“I’ve just thought — Hermione.” 
“What about her?” 
“She doesn’t know about the troll.” 
Ron bit his lip. 
“Oh, all right,” he snapped. “But Percy’d better not see us.” 
Ducking down, they joined the Hufflepuffs going the other way, 
slipped down a deserted side corridor, and hurried off toward the 
girls’ bathroom. They had just turned the corner when they heard 
quick footsteps behind them. 
“Percy!” hissed Ron, pulling Harry behind a large stone griffin. 
Peering around it, however, they saw not Percy but Snape. He 
crossed the corridor and disappeared from view. 
“What’s he doing?” Harry whispered. “Why isn’t he down in the 
dungeons with the rest of the teachers?” 
“Search me.” 
CHAPTER TEN 
 174 
Quietly as possible, they crept along the next corridor after 
Snape’s fading footsteps. 
“He’s heading for the third floor,” Harry said, but Ron held up 
his hand. 
“Can you smell something?” 
Harry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils, a mixture of 
old socks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to clean. 
And then they heard it — a low grunting, and the shuffling 
footfalls of gigantic feet. Ron pointed — at the end of a passage to 
the left, something huge was moving toward them. They shrank 
into the shadows and watched as it emerged into a patch of moonlight. 
It was a horrible sight. Twelve feet tall, its skin was a dull, granite gray, its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head 
perched on top like a coconut. It had short legs thick as tree trunks 
with flat, horny feet. The smell coming from it was incredible. It 
was holding a huge wooden club, which dragged along the floor 
because its arms were so long. 
The troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside. It waggled its long ears, making up its tiny mind, then slouched slowly 
into the room. 
“The key’s in the lock,” Harry muttered. “We could lock it in.” 
“Good idea,” said Ron nervously. 
They edged toward the open door, mouths dry, praying the troll 
wasn’t about to come out of it. With one great leap, Harry managed to grab the key, slam the door, and lock it. 
“Yes!” 
Flushed with their victory, they started to run back up the pas- 
HALLOWEEN 
 175 
sage, but as they reached the corner they heard something that 
made their hearts stop — a high, petrified scream — and it was 
coming from the chamber they’d just chained up. 
“Oh, no,” said Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron. 
“It’s the girls’ bathroom!” Harry gasped. 
“Hermione!” they said together. 
It was the last thing they wanted to do, but what choice did they 
have? Wheeling around, they sprinted back to the door and turned 
the key, fumbling in their panic. Harry pulled the door open and 
they ran inside. 
Hermione Granger was shrinking against the wall opposite, 
looking as if she was about to faint. The troll was advancing on her, 
knocking the sinks off the walls as it went. 
“Confuse it!” Harry said desperately to Ron, and, seizing a tap, 
he threw it as hard as he could against the wall. 
The troll stopped a few feet from Hermione. It lumbered 
around, blinking stupidly, to see what had made the noise. Its 
mean little eyes saw Harry. It hesitated, then made for him instead, 
lifting its club as it went. 
“Oy, pea-brain!” yelled Ron from the other side of the chamber, 
and he threw a metal pipe at it. The troll didn’t even seem to notice 
the pipe hitting its shoulder, but it heard the yell and paused again, 
turning its ugly snout toward Ron instead, giving Harry time to 
run around it. 
“Come on, run, run!” Harry yelled at Hermione, trying to pull 
her toward the door, but she couldn’t move, she was still flat against 
the wall, her mouth open with terror. 
The shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the troll 
CHAPTER TEN 
 176 
berserk. It roared again and started toward Ron, who was nearest 
and had no way to escape. 
Harry then did something that was both very brave and very stupid: He took a great running jump and managed to fasten his arms 
around the troll’s neck from behind. The troll couldn’t feel Harry 
hanging there, but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of 
wood up its nose, and Harry’s wand had still been in his hand when 
he’d jumped — it had gone straight up one of the troll’s nostrils. 
Howling with pain, the troll twisted and flailed its club, with 
Harry clinging on for dear life; any second, the troll was going to 
rip him off or catch him a terrible blow with the club. 
Hermione had sunk to the floor in fright; Ron pulled out his 
own wand — not knowing what he was going to do he heard himself cry the first spell that came into his head: “Wingardium 
Leviosa!” 
The club flew suddenly out of the troll’s hand, rose high, high 
up into the air, turned slowly over — and dropped, with a sickening crack, onto its owner’s head. The troll swayed on the spot and 
then fell flat on its face, with a thud that made the whole room 
tremble. 
Harry got to his feet. He was shaking and out of breath. Ron was 
standing there with his wand still raised, staring at what he had 
done. 
It was Hermione who spoke first. 
“Is it — dead?” 
“I don’t think so,” said Harry, “I think it’s just been knocked out.” 
He bent down and pulled his wand out of the troll’s nose. It was 
covered in what looked like lumpy gray glue. 
HALLOWEEN 
 177 
“Urgh — troll boogers.” 
He wiped it on the troll’s trousers. 
A sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the three of them 
look up. They hadn’t realized what a racket they had been making, 
but of course, someone downstairs must have heard the crashes and 
the troll’s roars. A moment later, Professor McGonagall had come 
bursting into the room, closely followed by Snape, with Quirrell 
bringing up the rear. Quirrell took one look at the troll, let out a 
faint whimper, and sat quickly down on a toilet, clutching his 
heart. 
Snape bent over the troll. Professor McGonagall was looking at 
Ron and Harry. Harry had never seen her look so angry. Her lips 
were white. Hopes of winning fifty points for Gryffindor faded 
quickly from Harry’s mind. 
“What on earth were you thinking of?” said Professor McGonagall, with cold fury in her voice. Harry looked at Ron, who was still 
standing with his wand in the air. “You’re lucky you weren’t killed. 
Why aren’t you in your dormitory?” 
Snape gave Harry a swift, piercing look. Harry looked at the 
floor. He wished Ron would put his wand down. 
Then a small voice came out of the shadows. 
“Please, Professor McGonagall — they were looking for me.” 
“Miss Granger!” 
Hermione had managed to get to her feet at last. 
“I went looking for the troll because I — I thought I could deal 
with it on my own — you know, because I’ve read all about them.” 
Ron dropped his wand. Hermione Granger, telling a downright 
lie to a teacher? 
CHAPTER TEN 
 178 
“If they hadn’t found me, I’d be dead now. Harry stuck his wand 
up its nose and Ron knocked it out with its own club. They didn’t 
have time to come and fetch anyone. It was about to finish me off 
when they arrived.” 
Harry and Ron tried to look as though this story wasn’t new to 
them. 
“Well — in that case . . .” said Professor McGonagall, staring at 
the three of them, “Miss Granger, you foolish girl, how could you 
think of tackling a mountain troll on your own?” 
Hermione hung her head. Harry was speechless. Hermione was 
the last person to do anything against the rules, and here she was, 
pretending she had, to get them out of trouble. It was as if Snape 
had started handing out sweets. 
“Miss Granger, five points will be taken from Gryffindor for 
this,” said Professor McGonagall. “I’m very disappointed in you. If 
you’re not hurt at all, you’d better get off to Gryffindor Tower. Students are finishing the feast in their Houses.” 
Hermione left. 
Professor McGonagall turned to Harry and Ron. 
“Well, I still say you were lucky, but not many first years could 
have taken on a full-grown mountain troll. You each win 
Gryffindor five points. Professor Dumbledore will be informed of 
this. You may go.” 
They hurried out of the chamber and didn’t speak at all until 
they had climbed two floors up. It was a relief to be away from the 
smell of the troll, quite apart from anything else. 
“We should have gotten more than ten points,” Ron grumbled. 
“Five, you mean, once she’s taken off Hermione’s.” 
HALLOWEEN 
 179 
“Good of her to get us out of trouble like that,” Ron admitted. 
“Mind you, we did save her.” 
“She might not have needed saving if we hadn’t locked the thing 
in with her,” Harry reminded him. 
They had reached the portrait of the Fat Lady. 
“Pig snout,” they said and entered. 
The common room was packed and noisy. Everyone was eating 
the food that had been sent up. Hermione, however, stood alone by 
the door, waiting for them. There was a very embarrassed pause. 
Then, none of them looking at each other, they all said “Thanks,” 
and hurried off to get plates. 
But from that moment on, Hermione Granger became their 
friend. There are some things you can’t share without ending up 
liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is 
one of them.

s they entered November, the weather turned very cold. The 
mountains around the school became icy gray and the 
lake like chilled steel. Every morning the ground was covered 
in frost. Hagrid could be seen from the upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on the Quidditch field, bundled up in a long 
moleskin overcoat, rabbit fur gloves, and enormous beaverskin 
boots. 
The Quidditch season had begun. On Saturday, Harry would be 
playing in his first match after weeks of training: Gryffindor versus 
Slytherin. If Gryffindor won, they would move up into second 
place in the House Championship. 
Hardly anyone had seen Harry play because Wood had decided 
that, as their secret weapon, Harry should be kept, well, secret. But 
the news that he was playing Seeker had leaked out somehow, and 
Harry didn’t know which was worse — people telling him he’d be 
A
QUIDDITCH 
 181 
brilliant or people telling him they’d be running around underneath him holding a mattress. 
It was really lucky that Harry now had Hermione as a friend. He 
didn’t know how he’d have gotten through all his homework without her, what with all the last-minute Quidditch practice Wood 
was making them do. She had also lent him Quidditch Through the 
Ages, which turned out to be a very interesting read. 
Harry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a Quidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a 
World Cup match in 1473; that Seekers were usually the smallest 
and fastest players, and that most serious Quidditch accidents 
seemed to happen to them; that although people rarely died playing Quidditch, referees had been known to vanish and turn up 
months later in the Sahara Desert. 
Hermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules 
since Harry and Ron had saved her from the mountain troll, and 
she was much nicer for it. The day before Harry’s first Quidditch 
match the three of them were out in the freezing courtyard during 
break, and she had conjured them up a bright blue fire that could 
be carried around in a jam jar. They were standing with their backs 
to it, getting warm, when Snape crossed the yard. Harry noticed at 
once that Snape was limping. Harry, Ron, and Hermione moved 
closer together to block the fire from view; they were sure it 
wouldn’t be allowed. Unfortunately, something about their guilty 
faces caught Snape’s eye. He limped over. He hadn’t seen the fire, 
but he seemed to be looking for a reason to tell them off anyway. 
“What’s that you’ve got there, Potter?” 
It was Quidditch Through the Ages. Harry showed him. 
CHAPTER ELEVEN 
 182 
“Library books are not to be taken outside the school,” said 
Snape. “Give it to me. Five points from Gryffindor.” 
“He’s just made that rule up,” Harry muttered angrily as Snape 
limped away. “Wonder what’s wrong with his leg?” 
“Dunno, but I hope it’s really hurting him,” said Ron bitterly. 
The Gryffindor common room was very noisy that evening. Harry, 
Ron, and Hermione sat together next to a window. Hermione was 
checking Harry and Ron’s Charms homework for them. She would 
never let them copy (“How will you learn?”), but by asking her to 
read it through, they got the right answers anyway. 
Harry felt restless. He wanted Quidditch Through the Ages back, 
to take his mind off his nerves about tomorrow. Why should he be 
afraid of Snape? Getting up, he told Ron and Hermione he was going to ask Snape if he could have it. 
“Better you than me,” they said together, but Harry had an idea 
that Snape wouldn’t refuse if there were other teachers listening. 
He made his way down to the staffroom and knocked. There 
was no answer. He knocked again. Nothing. 
Perhaps Snape had left the book in there? It was worth a try. He 
pushed the door ajar and peered inside — and a horrible scene met 
his eyes. 
Snape and Filch were inside, alone. Snape was holding his robes 
above his knees. One of his legs was bloody and mangled. Filch was 
handing Snape bandages. 
“Blasted thing,” Snape was saying. “How are you supposed to 
keep your eyes on all three heads at once?” 
Harry tried to shut the door quietly, but — 
QUIDDITCH 
 183 
“POTTER!” 
Snape’s face was twisted with fury as he dropped his robes 
quickly to hide his leg. Harry gulped. 
“I just wondered if I could have my book back.” 
“GET OUT! OUT!” 
Harry left, before Snape could take any more points from 
Gryffindor. He sprinted back upstairs. 
“Did you get it?” Ron asked as Harry joined them. “What’s the 
matter?” 
In a low whisper, Harry told them what he’d seen. 
“You know what this means?” he finished breathlessly. “He tried 
to get past that three-headed dog at Halloween! That’s where he 
was going when we saw him — he’s after whatever it’s guarding! 
And I’d bet my broomstick he let that troll in, to make a diversion!” 
Hermione’s eyes were wide. 
“No — he wouldn’t,” she said. “I know he’s not very nice, but he 
wouldn’t try and steal something Dumbledore was keeping safe.” 
“Honestly, Hermione, you think all teachers are saints or something,” snapped Ron. “I’m with Harry. I wouldn’t put anything 
past Snape. But what’s he after? What’s that dog guarding?” 
Harry went to bed with his head buzzing with the same question. Neville was snoring loudly, but Harry couldn’t sleep. He tried 
to empty his mind — he needed to sleep, he had to, he had his first 
Quidditch match in a few hours — but the expression on Snape’s 
face when Harry had seen his leg wasn’t easy to forget. 
The next morning dawned very bright and cold. The Great Hall 
was full of the delicious smell of fried sausages and the cheer- 
CHAPTER ELEVEN 
 184 
ful chatter of everyone looking forward to a good Quidditch 
match. 
“You’ve got to eat some breakfast.” 
“I don’t want anything.” 
“Just a bit of toast,” wheedled Hermione. 
“I’m not hungry.” 
Harry felt terrible. In an hour’s time he’d be walking onto the 
field. 
“Harry, you need your strength,” said Seamus Finnigan. “Seekers are always the ones who get clobbered by the other team.” 
“Thanks, Seamus,” said Harry, watching Seamus pile ketchup 
on his sausages. 
By eleven o’clock the whole school seemed to be out in the stands 
around the Quidditch pitch. Many students had binoculars. The 
seats might be raised high in the air, but it was still difficult to see 
what was going on sometimes. 
Ron and Hermione joined Neville, Seamus, and Dean the West 
Ham fan up in the top row. As a surprise for Harry, they had 
painted a large banner on one of the sheets Scabbers had ruined. It 
said Potter for President, and Dean, who was good at drawing, had 
done a large Gryffindor lion underneath. Then Hermione had 
performed a tricky little charm so that the paint flashed different 
colors. 
Meanwhile, in the locker room, Harry and the rest of the team 
were changing into their scarlet Quidditch robes (Slytherin would 
be playing in green). 
Wood cleared his throat for silence. 
QUIDDITCH 
 185 
“Okay, men,” he said. 
“And women,” said Chaser Angelina Johnson. 
“And women,” Wood agreed. “This is it.” 
“The big one,” said Fred Weasley. 
“The one we’ve all been waiting for,” said George. 
“We know Oliver’s speech by heart,” Fred told Harry, “we were 
on the team last year.” 
“Shut up, you two,” said Wood. “This is the best team Gryffindor’s had in years. We’re going to win. I know it.” 
He glared at them all as if to say, “Or else.” 
“Right. It’s time. Good luck, all of you.” 
Harry followed Fred and George out of the locker room and, 
hoping his knees weren’t going to give way, walked onto the field to 
loud cheers. 
Madam Hooch was refereeing. She stood in the middle of the 
field waiting for the two teams, her broom in her hand. 
“Now, I want a nice fair game, all of you,” she said, once they 
were all gathered around her. Harry noticed that she seemed to be 
speaking particularly to the Slytherin Captain, Marcus Flint, a fifth 
year. Harry thought Flint looked as if he had some troll blood in 
him. Out of the corner of his eye he saw the fluttering banner high 
above, flashing Potter for President over the crowd. His heart 
skipped. He felt braver. 
“Mount your brooms, please.” 
Harry clambered onto his Nimbus Two Thousand. 
Madam Hooch gave a loud blast on her silver whistle. 
Fifteen brooms rose up, high, high into the air. They were off. 
“And the Quaffle is taken immediately by Angelina Johnson of 
CHAPTER ELEVEN 
 186 
Gryffindor — what an excellent Chaser that girl is, and rather attractive, too —” 
“JORDAN!” 
“Sorry, Professor.” 
The Weasley twins’ friend, Lee Jordan, was doing the commentary for the match, closely watched by Professor McGonagall. 
“And she’s really belting along up there, a neat pass to Alicia 
Spinnet, a good find of Oliver Wood’s, last year only a reserve — 
back to Johnson and — no, the Slytherins have taken the Quaffle, 
Slytherin Captain Marcus Flint gains the Quaffle and off he 
goes — Flint flying like an eagle up there — he’s going to sc- no, 
stopped by an excellent move by Gryffindor Keeper Wood and 
the Gryffindors take the Quaffle — that’s Chaser Katie Bell of 
Gryffindor there, nice dive around Flint, off up the field and — 
OUCH — that must have hurt, hit in the back of the head by a 
Bludger — Quaffle taken by the Slytherins — that’s Adrian Pucey 
speeding off toward the goal posts, but he’s blocked by a second 
Bludger — sent his way by Fred or George Weasley, can’t tell 
which — nice play by the Gryffindor Beater, anyway, and Johnson 
back in possession of the Quaffle, a clear field ahead and off she 
goes — she’s really flying — dodges a speeding Bludger — the 
goal posts are ahead — come on, now, Angelina — Keeper Bletchley dives — misses — GRYFFINDORS SCORE!” 
Gryffindor cheers filled the cold air, with howls and moans from 
the Slytherins. 
“Budge up there, move along.” 
“Hagrid!” 
Ron and Hermione squeezed together to give Hagrid enough 
space to join them. 
QUIDDITCH 
 187 
“Bin watchin’ from me hut,” said Hagrid, patting a large pair of 
binoculars around his neck, “But it isn’t the same as bein’ in the 
crowd. No sign of the Snitch yet, eh?” 
“Nope,” said Ron. “Harry hasn’t had much to do yet.” 
“Kept outta trouble, though, that’s somethin’,” said Hagrid, raising his binoculars and peering skyward at the speck that was Harry. 
Way up above them, Harry was gliding over the game, squinting 
about for some sign of the Snitch. This was part of his and Wood’s 
game plan. 
“Keep out of the way until you catch sight of the Snitch,” Wood 
had said. “We don’t want you attacked before you have to be.” 
When Angelina had scored, Harry had done a couple of loopthe-loops to let off his feelings. Now he was back to staring around 
for the Snitch. Once he caught sight of a flash of gold, but it was 
just a reflection from one of the Weasleys’ wristwatches, and once a 
Bludger decided to come pelting his way, more like a cannonball 
than anything, but Harry dodged it and Fred Weasley came chasing after it. 
“All right there, Harry?” he had time to yell, as he beat the 
Bludger furiously toward Marcus Flint. 
“Slytherin in possession,” Lee Jordan was saying, “Chaser Pucey 
ducks two Bludgers, two Weasleys, and Chaser Bell, and speeds 
toward the — wait a moment — was that the Snitch?” 
A murmur ran through the crowd as Adrian Pucey dropped the 
Quaffle, too busy looking over his shoulder at the flash of gold that 
had passed his left ear. 
Harry saw it. In a great rush of excitement he dived downward 
after the streak of gold. Slytherin Seeker Terence Higgs had seen it, 
too. Neck and neck they hurtled toward the Snitch — all the 
CHAPTER ELEVEN 
 188 
Chasers seemed to have forgotten what they were supposed to be 
doing as they hung in midair to watch. 
Harry was faster than Higgs — he could see the little round ball, 
wings fluttering, darting up ahead — he put on an extra spurt of 
speed — 
WHAM! A roar of rage echoed from the Gryffindors below — 
Marcus Flint had blocked Harry on purpose, and Harry’s broom 
spun off course, Harry holding on for dear life. 
“Foul!” screamed the Gryffindors. 
Madam Hooch spoke angrily to Flint and then ordered a free 
shot at the goal posts for Gryffindor. But in all the confusion, of 
course, the Golden Snitch had disappeared from sight again. 
Down in the stands, Dean Thomas was yelling, “Send him off, 
ref! Red card!” 
“What are you talking about, Dean?” said Ron. 
“Red card!” said Dean furiously. “In soccer you get shown the 
red card and you’re out of the game!” 
“But this isn’t soccer, Dean,” Ron reminded him. 
Hagrid, however, was on Dean’s side. 
“They oughta change the rules. Flint coulda knocked Harry 
outta the air.” 
Lee Jordan was finding it difficult not to take sides. 
“So — after that obvious and disgusting bit of cheating —” 
“Jordan!” growled Professor McGonagall. 
“I mean, after that open and revolting foul —” 
“Jordan, I’m warning you —” 
“All right, all right. Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor Seeker, which 
could happen to anyone, I’m sure, so a penalty to Gryffindor,

 189 
taken by Spinnet, who puts it away, no trouble, and we continue 
play, Gryffindor still in possession.” 
It was as Harry dodged another Bludger, which went spinning 
dangerously past his head, that it happened. His broom gave a sudden, frightening lurch. For a split second, he thought he was going 
to fall. He gripped the broom tightly with both his hands and 
knees. He’d never felt anything like that. 
It happened again. It was as though the broom was trying to 
buck him off. But Nimbus Two Thousands did not suddenly decide to buck their riders off. Harry tried to turn back toward the 
Gryffindor goal posts — he had half a mind to ask Wood to call 
time-out — and then he realized that his broom was completely 
out of his control. He couldn’t turn it. He couldn’t direct it at all. It 
was zigzagging through the air, and every now and then making violent swishing movements that almost unseated him. 
Lee was still commentating. 
“Slytherin in possession — Flint with the Quaffle — passes 
Spinnet — passes Bell — hit hard in the face by a Bludger, hope it 
broke his nose — only joking, Professor — Slytherins score — oh 
no . . .” 
The Slytherins were cheering. No one seemed to have noticed 
that Harry’s broom was behaving strangely It was carrying him 
slowly higher, away from the game, jerking and twitching as it 
went. 
“Dunno what Harry thinks he’s doing,” Hagrid mumbled. He 
stared through his binoculars. “If I didn’ know better, I’d say he’d 
lost control of his broom . . . but he can’t have. . . .” 
Suddenly, people were pointing up at Harry all over the stands. 
CHAPTER ELEVEN 
 190 
His broom had started to roll over and over, with him only just 
managing to hold on. Then the whole crowd gasped. Harry’s 
broom had given a wild jerk and Harry swung off it. He was now 
dangling from it, holding on with only one hand. 
“Did something happen to it when Flint blocked him?” Seamus 
whispered. 
“Can’t have,” Hagrid said, his voice shaking. “Can’t nothing interfere with a broomstick except powerful Dark magic — no kid 
could do that to a Nimbus Two Thousand.” 
At these words, Hermione seized Hagrid’s binoculars, but instead of looking up at Harry, she started looking frantically at the 
crowd. 
“What are you doing?” moaned Ron, gray-faced. 
“I knew it,” Hermione gasped, “Snape — look.” 
Ron grabbed the binoculars. Snape was in the middle of the 
stands opposite them. He had his eyes fixed on Harry and was muttering nonstop under his breath. 
“He’s doing something — jinxing the broom,” said Hermione. 
“What should we do?” 
“Leave it to me.” 
Before Ron could say another word, Hermione had disappeared. 
Ron turned the binoculars back on Harry. His broom was vibrating so hard, it was almost impossible for him to hang on much 
longer. The whole crowd was on its feet, watching, terrified, as 
the Weasleys flew up to try and pull Harry safely onto one of 
their brooms, but it was no good — every time they got near him, 
the broom would jump higher still. They dropped lower and circled beneath him, obviously hoping to catch him if he fell. Marcus 
QUIDDITCH 
 191 
Flint seized the Quaffle and scored five times without anyone 
noticing. 
“Come on, Hermione,” Ron muttered desperately. 
Hermione had fought her way across to the stand where Snape 
stood, and was now racing along the row behind him; she didn’t 
even stop to say sorry as she knocked Professor Quirrell headfirst 
into the row in front. Reaching Snape, she crouched down, pulled 
out her wand, and whispered a few, well-chosen words. Bright blue 
flames shot from her wand onto the hem of Snape’s robes. 
It took perhaps thirty seconds for Snape to realize that he was on 
fire. A sudden yelp told her she had done her job. Scooping the fire 
off him into a little jar in her pocket, she scrambled back along the 
row — Snape would never know what had happened. 
It was enough. Up in the air, Harry was suddenly able to clamber back on to his broom. 
“Neville, you can look!” Ron said. Neville had been sobbing into 
Hagrid’s jacket for the last five minutes. 
Harry was speeding toward the ground when the crowd saw him 
clap his hand to his mouth as though he was about to be sick — he 
hit the field on all fours — coughed — and something gold fell 
into his hand. 
“I’ve got the Snitch!” he shouted, waving it above his head, and 
the game ended in complete confusion. 
“He didn’t catch it, he nearly swallowed it,” Flint was still howling twenty minutes later, but it made no difference — Harry 
hadn’t broken any rules and Lee Jordan was still happily shouting 
the results — Gryffindor had won by one hundred and seventy 
points to sixty. Harry heard none of this, though. He was being

 192 
made a cup of strong tea back in Hagrid’s hut, with Ron and 
Hermione. 
“It was Snape,” Ron was explaining, “Hermione and I saw him. 
He was cursing your broomstick, muttering, he wouldn’t take his 
eyes off you.” 
“Rubbish,” said Hagrid, who hadn’t heard a word of what had 
gone on next to him in the stands. “Why would Snape do somethin’ like that?” 
Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another, wondering 
what to tell him. Harry decided on the truth. 
“I found out something about him,” he told Hagrid. “He tried 
to get past that three-headed dog on Halloween. It bit him. We 
think he was trying to steal whatever it’s guarding.” 
Hagrid dropped the teapot. 
“How do you know about Fluffy?” he said. 
“Fluffy?” 
“Yeah — he’s mine — bought him off a Greek chappie I met in 
the pub las’ year — I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the —” 
“Yes?” said Harry eagerly. 
“Now, don’t ask me anymore,” said Hagrid gruffly. “That’s top 
secret, that is.” 
“But Snape’s trying to steal it.” 
“Rubbish,” said Hagrid again. “Snape’s a Hogwarts teacher, he’d 
do nothin’ of the sort.” 
“So why did he just try and kill Harry?” cried Hermione. 
The afternoon’s events certainly seemed to have changed her 
mind about Snape. 
“I know a jinx when I see one, Hagrid, I’ve read all about them! 
QUIDDITCH 
 193 
You’ve got to keep eye contact, and Snape wasn’t blinking at all, I 
saw him!” 
“I’m tellin’ yeh, yer wrong!” said Hagrid hotly. “I don’ know why 
Harry’s broom acted like that, but Snape wouldn’ try an’ kill a student! Now, listen to me, all three of yeh — yer meddlin’ in things 
that don’ concern yeh. It’s dangerous. You forget that dog, an’ you 
forget what it’s guardin’, that’s between Professor Dumbledore an’ 
Nicolas Flamel —” 
“Aha!” said Harry, “so there’s someone called Nicolas Flamel involved, is there?” 
Hagrid looked furious with himself.

hristmas was coming. One morning in mid-December, 
Hogwarts woke to find itself covered in several feet of snow. 
The lake froze solid and the Weasley twins were punished for bewitching several snowballs so that they followed Quirrell around, 
bouncing off the back of his turban. The few owls that managed to 
battle their way through the stormy sky to deliver mail had to be 
nursed back to health by Hagrid before they could fly off again. 
No one could wait for the holidays to start. While the Gryffindor common room and the Great Hall had roaring fires, the 
drafty corridors had become icy and a bitter wind rattled the 
windows in the classrooms. Worst of all were Professor Snape’s 
classes down in the dungeons, where their breath rose in a mist 
before them and they kept as close as possible to their hot cauldrons. 
“I do feel so sorry,” said Draco Malfoy, one Potions class, “for all 
C 
THE MIRROR OF ERISED 
 195 
those people who have to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas because 
they’re not wanted at home.” 
He was looking over at Harry as he spoke. Crabbe and Goyle 
chuckled. Harry, who was measuring out powdered spine of lionfish, ignored them. Malfoy had been even more unpleasant than 
usual since the Quidditch match. Disgusted that the Slytherins had 
lost, he had tried to get everyone laughing at how a wide-mouthed 
tree frog would be replacing Harry as Seeker next. Then he’d realized that nobody found this funny, because they were all so impressed at the way Harry had managed to stay on his bucking 
broomstick. So Malfoy, jealous and angry, had gone back to taunting Harry about having no proper family. 
It was true that Harry wasn’t going back to Privet Drive for 
Christmas. Professor McGonagall had come around the week before, making a list of students who would be staying for the holidays, and Harry had signed up at once. He didn’t feel sorry for 
himself at all; this would probably be the best Christmas he’d ever 
had. Ron and his brothers were staying, too, because Mr. and Mrs. 
Weasley were going to Romania to visit Charlie. 
When they left the dungeons at the end of Potions, they found 
a large fir tree blocking the corridor ahead. Two enormous feet 
sticking out at the bottom and a loud puffing sound told them that 
Hagrid was behind it. 
“Hi, Hagrid, want any help?” Ron asked, sticking his head 
through the branches. 
“Nah, I’m all right, thanks, Ron.” 
“Would you mind moving out of the way?” came Malfoy’s cold 
drawl from behind them. “Are you trying to earn some extra 
CHAPTER TWELVE 
 196 
money, Weasley? Hoping to be gamekeeper yourself when you 
leave Hogwarts, I suppose — that hut of Hagrid’s must seem like a 
palace compared to what your family’s used to.” 
Ron dived at Malfoy just as Snape came up the stairs. 
“WEASLEY!” 
Ron let go of the front of Malfoy’s robes. 
“He was provoked, Professor Snape,” said Hagrid, sticking his 
huge hairy face out from behind the tree. “Malfoy was insultin’ his 
family.” 
“Be that as it may, fighting is against Hogwarts rules, Hagrid,” 
said Snape silkily. “Five points from Gryffindor, Weasley, and be 
grateful it isn’t more. Move along, all of you.” 
Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle pushed roughly past the tree, scattering needles everywhere and smirking. 
“I’ll get him,” said Ron, grinding his teeth at Malfoy’s back, “one 
of these days, I’ll get him —” 
“I hate them both,” said Harry, “Malfoy and Snape.” 
“Come on, cheer up, it’s nearly Christmas,” said Hagrid. “Tell 
yeh what, come with me an’ see the Great Hall, looks a treat.” 
So the three of them followed Hagrid and his tree off to the 
Great Hall, where Professor McGonagall and Professor Flitwick 
were busy with the Christmas decorations. 
“Ah, Hagrid, the last tree — put it in the far corner, would you?” 
The hall looked spectacular. Festoons of holly and mistletoe 
hung all around the walls, and no less than twelve towering Christmas trees stood around the room, some sparkling with tiny icicles, 
some glittering with hundreds of candles. 
“How many days you got left until yer holidays?” Hagrid asked. 
THE MIRROR OF ERISED 
 197 
“Just one,” said Hermione. “And that reminds me — Harry, 
Ron, we’ve got half an hour before lunch, we should be in the library.” 
“Oh yeah, you’re right,” said Ron, tearing his eyes away from 
Professor Flitwick, who had golden bubbles blossoming out of his 
wand and was trailing them over the branches of the new tree. 
“The library?” said Hagrid, following them out of the hall. “Just 
before the holidays? Bit keen, aren’t yeh?” 
“Oh, we’re not working,” Harry told him brightly. “Ever since 
you mentioned Nicolas Flamel we’ve been trying to find out who 
he is.” 
“You what?” Hagrid looked shocked. “Listen here — I’ve told 
yeh — drop it. It’s nothin’ to you what that dog’s guardin’.” 
“We just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is, that’s all,” said 
Hermione. 
“Unless you’d like to tell us and save us the trouble?” Harry 
added. “We must’ve been through hundreds of books already and 
we can’t find him anywhere — just give us a hint — I know I’ve 
read his name somewhere.” 
“I’m sayin’ nothin’,” said Hagrid flatly. 
“Just have to find out for ourselves, then,” said Ron, and they 
left Hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried off to the library. 
They had indeed been searching books for Flamel’s name ever 
since Hagrid had let it slip, because how else were they going to 
find out what Snape was trying to steal? The trouble was, it was very 
hard to know where to begin, not knowing what Flamel might 
have done to get himself into a book. He wasn’t in Great Wizards of 
the Twentieth Century, or Notable Magical Names of Our Time; he 
CHAPTER TWELVE 
 198 
was missing, too, from Important Modern Magical Discoveries, and 
A Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry. And then, of course, 
there was the sheer size of the library; tens of thousands of books; 
thousands of shelves; hundreds of narrow rows. 
Hermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had decided 
to search while Ron strode off down a row of books and started 
pulling them off the shelves at random. Harry wandered over to 
the Restricted Section. He had been wondering for a while if 
Flamel wasn’t somewhere in there. Unfortunately, you needed a 
specially signed note from one of the teachers to look in any of the 
restricted books, and he knew he’d never get one. These were the 
books containing powerful Dark Magic never taught at Hogwarts, 
and only read by older students studying advanced Defense 
Against the Dark Arts. 
“What are you looking for, boy?” 
“Nothing,” said Harry. 
Madam Pince the librarian brandished a feather duster at him. 
“You’d better get out, then. Go on — out!” 
Wishing he’d been a bit quicker at thinking up some story, 
Harry left the library. He, Ron, and Hermione had already agreed 
they’d better not ask Madam Pince where they could find Flamel. 
They were sure she’d be able to tell them, but they couldn’t risk 
Snape hearing what they were up to. 
Harry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had 
found anything, but he wasn’t very hopeful. They had been looking for two weeks, after all, but as they only had odd moments between lessons it wasn’t surprising they’d found nothing. What they 
really needed was a nice long search without Madam Pince breathing down their necks. 
THE MIRROR OF ERISED 
 199 
Five minutes later, Ron and Hermione joined him, shaking their 
heads. They went off to lunch. 
“You will keep looking while I’m away, won’t you?” said 
Hermione. “And send me an owl if you find anything.” 
“And you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel is,” 
said Ron. “It’d be safe to ask them.” 
“Very safe, as they’re both dentists,” said Hermione. 
Once the holidays had started, Ron and Harry were having too 
good a time to think much about Flamel. They had the dormitory 
to themselves and the common room was far emptier than usual, 
so they were able to get the good armchairs by the fire. They sat by 
the hour eating anything they could spear on a toasting fork — 
bread, English muffins, marshmallows — and plotting ways of getting Malfoy expelled, which were fun to talk about even if they 
wouldn’t work. 
Ron also started teaching Harry wizard chess. This was exactly 
like Muggle chess except that the figures were alive, which made 
it a lot like directing troops in battle. Ron’s set was very old and 
battered. Like everything else he owned, it had once belonged 
to someone else in his family — in this case, his grandfather. 
However, old chessmen weren’t a drawback at all. Ron knew 
them so well he never had trouble getting them to do what he 
wanted. 
Harry played with chessmen Seamus Finnigan had lent him, 
and they didn’t trust him at all. He wasn’t a very good player yet 
and they kept shouting different bits of advice at him, which was 
confusing. “Don’t send me there, can’t you see his knight? Send 
him, we can afford to lose him.” 
CHAPTER TWELVE 
 200 
On Christmas Eve, Harry went to bed looking forward to the 
next day for the food and the fun, but not expecting any presents 
at all. When he woke early in the morning, however, the first thing 
he saw was a small pile of packages at the foot of his bed. 
“Merry Christmas,” said Ron sleepily as Harry scrambled out of 
bed and pulled on his bathrobe. 
“You, too,” said Harry. “Will you look at this? I’ve got some presents!” 
“What did you expect, turnips?” said Ron, turning to his own 
pile, which was a lot bigger than Harry’s. 
Harry picked up the top parcel. It was wrapped in thick brown 
paper and scrawled across it was To Harry, from Hagrid. Inside was 
a roughly cut wooden flute. Hagrid had obviously whittled it himself. Harry blew it — it sounded a bit like an owl. 
A second, very small parcel contained a note. 
We received your message and enclose your Christmas present. From 
Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia. Taped to the note was a fifty-pence 
piece. 
“That’s friendly,” said Harry. 
Ron was fascinated by the fifty pence. 
“Weird!” he said, “What a shape! This is money?” 
“You can keep it,” said Harry, laughing at how pleased Ron was. 
“Hagrid and my aunt and uncle — so who sent these?” 
“I think I know who that one’s from,” said Ron, turning a bit 
pink and pointing to a very lumpy parcel. “My mom. I told her 
you didn’t expect any presents and — oh, no,” he groaned, “she’s 
made you a Weasley sweater.” 
Harry had torn open the parcel to find a thick, hand-knitted 
sweater in emerald green and a large box of homemade fudge. 
THE MIRROR OF ERISED 
 201 
“Every year she makes us a sweater,” said Ron, unwrapping his 
own, “and mine’s always maroon.” 
“That’s really nice of her,” said Harry, trying the fudge, which 
was very tasty. 
His next present also contained candy — a large box of Chocolate Frogs from Hermione. 
This only left one parcel. Harry picked it up and felt it. It was 
very light. He unwrapped it. 
Something fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the floor 
where it lay in gleaming folds. Ron gasped. 
“I’ve heard of those,” he said in a hushed voice, dropping the 
box of Every Flavor Beans he’d gotten from Hermione. “If that’s 
what I think it is — they’re really rare, and really valuable.” 
“What is it?” 
Harry picked the shining, silvery cloth off the floor. It was 
strange to the touch, like water woven into material. 
“It’s an Invisibility Cloak,” said Ron, a look of awe on his face. 
“I’m sure it is — try it on.” 
Harry threw the cloak around his shoulders and Ron gave a yell. 
“It is! Look down!” 
Harry looked down at his feet, but they were gone. He dashed 
to the mirror. Sure enough, his reflection looked back at him, just 
his head suspended in midair, his body completely invisible. He 
pulled the cloak over his head and his reflection vanished completely. 
“There’s a note!” said Ron suddenly. “A note fell out of it!” 
Harry pulled off the cloak and seized the letter. Written in narrow, loopy writing he had never seen before were the following 
words: 
CHAPTER TWELVE 
 202 
Your father left this in my possession before 
he died. It is time it was returned to you. 
Use it well. 
A Very Merry Christmas to you. 
There was no signature. Harry stared at the note. Ron was admiring the cloak. 
“I’d give anything for one of these,” he said. “Anything. What’s 
the matter?” 
“Nothing,” said Harry. He felt very strange. Who had sent the 
cloak? Had it really once belonged to his father? 
Before he could say or think anything else, the dormitory door 
was flung open and Fred and George Weasley bounded in. Harry 
stuffed the cloak quickly out of sight. He didn’t feel like sharing it 
with anyone else yet. 
“Merry Christmas!” 
“Hey, look — Harry’s got a Weasley sweater, too!” 
Fred and George were wearing blue sweaters, one with a large 
yellow F on it, the other a G. 
“Harry’s is better than ours, though,” said Fred, holding up 
Harry’s sweater. “She obviously makes more of an effort if you’re 
not family.” 
“Why aren’t you wearing yours, Ron?” George demanded. 
“Come on, get it on, they’re lovely and warm.” 
“I hate maroon,” Ron moaned halfheartedly as he pulled it over 
his head. 
“You haven’t got a letter on yours,” George observed. “I suppose 
she thinks you don’t forget your name. But we’re not stupid — we 
know we’re called Gred and Forge.” 
THE MIRROR OF ERISED 
 203 
“What’s all this noise?” 
Percy Weasley stuck his head through the door, looking disapproving. He had clearly gotten halfway through unwrapping his 
presents as he, too, carried a lumpy sweater over his arm, which 
Fred seized. 
“P for prefect! Get it on, Percy, come on, we’re all wearing ours, 
even Harry got one.” 
“I — don’t — want —” said Percy thickly, as the twins forced 
the sweater over his head, knocking his glasses askew. 
“And you’re not sitting with the prefects today, either,” said 
George. “Christmas is a time for family.” 
They frog-marched Percy from the room, his arms pinned to his 
side by his sweater. 
Harry had never in all his life had such a Christmas dinner. A hundred fat, roast turkeys; mountains of roast and boiled potatoes; 
platters of chipolatas; tureens of buttered peas, silver boats of thick, 
rich gravy and cranberry sauce — and stacks of wizard crackers 
every few feet along the table. These fantastic party favors were 
nothing like the feeble Muggle ones the Dursleys usually bought, 
with their little plastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside. 
Harry pulled a wizard cracker with Fred and it didn’t just bang, it 
went off with a blast like a cannon and engulfed them all in a cloud 
of blue smoke, while from the inside exploded a rear admiral’s hat 
and several live, white mice. Up at the High Table, Dumbledore 
had swapped his pointed wizard’s hat for a flowered bonnet, and 
was chuckling merrily at a joke Professor Flitwick had just read him. 
Flaming Christmas puddings followed the turkey. Percy nearly 
broke his teeth on a silver Sickle embedded in his slice. Harry 
CHAPTER TWELVE 
 204 
watched Hagrid getting redder and redder in the face as he called 
for more wine, finally kissing Professor McGonagall on the cheek, 
who, to Harry’s amazement, giggled and blushed, her top hat lopsided. 
When Harry finally left the table, he was laden down with a 
stack of things out of the crackers, including a pack of nonexplodable, luminous balloons, a Grow-Your-Own-Warts kit, and 
his own new wizard chess set. The white mice had disappeared and 
Harry had a nasty feeling they were going to end up as Mrs. Norris’s Christmas dinner. 
Harry and the Weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furious snowball fight on the grounds. Then, cold, wet, and gasping 
for breath, they returned to the fire in the Gryffindor common 
room, where Harry broke in his new chess set by losing spectacularly to Ron. He suspected he wouldn’t have lost so badly if Percy 
hadn’t tried to help him so much. 
After a meal of turkey sandwiches, crumpets, trifle, and Christmas cake, everyone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed 
except sit and watch Percy chase Fred and George all over 
Gryffindor Tower because they’d stolen his prefect badge. 
It had been Harry’s best Christmas day ever. Yet something had 
been nagging at the back of his mind all day. Not until he climbed 
into bed was he free to think about it: the Invisibility Cloak and 
whoever had sent it. 
Ron, full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to 
bother him, fell asleep almost as soon as he’d drawn the curtains of 
his four-poster. Harry leaned over the side of his own bed and 
pulled the cloak out from under it. 
THE MIRROR OF ERISED 
 205 
His father’s . . . this had been his father’s. He let the material 
flow over his hands, smoother than silk, light as air. Use it well, the 
note had said. 
He had to try it, now. He slipped out of bed and wrapped the 
cloak around himself. Looking down at his legs, he saw only moonlight and shadows. It was a very funny feeling. 
Use it well.
Suddenly, Harry felt wide-awake. The whole of Hogwarts was 
open to him in this cloak. Excitement flooded through him as he 
stood there in the dark and silence. He could go anywhere in this, 
anywhere, and Filch would never know. 
Ron grunted in his sleep. Should Harry wake him? Something 
held him back — his father’s cloak — he felt that this time — the 
first time — he wanted to use it alone. 
He crept out of the dormitory, down the stairs, across the common room, and climbed through the portrait hole. 
“Who’s there?” squawked the Fat Lady. Harry said nothing. He 
walked quickly down the corridor. 
Where should he go? He stopped, his heart racing, and thought. 
And then it came to him. The Restricted Section in the library. 
He’d be able to read as long as he liked, as long as it took to find out 
who Flamel was. He set off, drawing the Invisibility Cloak tight 
around him as he walked. 
The library was pitch-black and very eerie. Harry lit a lamp to 
see his way along the rows of books. The lamp looked as if it was 
floating along in midair, and even though Harry could feel his arm 
supporting it, the sight gave him the creeps. 
The Restricted Section was right at the back of the library. Step- 
CHAPTER TWELVE 
 206 
ping carefully over the rope that separated these books from the 
rest of the library, he held up his lamp to read the titles. 
They didn’t tell him much. Their peeling, faded gold letters 
spelled words in languages Harry couldn’t understand. Some had 
no title at all. One book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly 
like blood. The hairs on the back of Harry’s neck prickled. Maybe 
he was imagining it, maybe not, but he thought a faint whispering 
was coming from the books, as though they knew someone was 
there who shouldn’t be. 
He had to start somewhere. Setting the lamp down carefully 
on the floor, he looked along the bottom shelf for an interestinglooking book. A large black and silver volume caught his eye. He 
pulled it out with difficulty, because it was very heavy, and, balancing it on his knee, let it fall open. 
A piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split the silence — the book 
was screaming! Harry snapped it shut, but the shriek went on and 
on, one high, unbroken, earsplitting note. He stumbled backward 
and knocked over his lamp, which went out at once. Panicking, he 
heard footsteps coming down the corridor outside — stuffing the 
shrieking book back on the shelf, he ran for it. He passed Filch in 
the doorway; Filch’s pale, wild eyes looked straight through him, 
and Harry slipped under Filch’s outstretched arm and streaked off 
up the corridor, the book’s shrieks still ringing in his ears. 
He came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor. He had 
been so busy getting away from the library, he hadn’t paid attention 
to where he was going. Perhaps because it was dark, he didn’t recognize where he was at all. There was a suit of armor near the 
kitchens, he knew, but he must be five floors above there. 
THE MIRROR OF ERISED 
 207 
“You asked me to come directly to you, Professor, if anyone was 
wandering around at night, and somebody’s been in the library — 
Restricted Section.” 
Harry felt the blood drain out of his face. Wherever he was, 
Filch must know a shortcut, because his soft, greasy voice was getting nearer, and to his horror, it was Snape who replied, “The Restricted Section? Well, they can’t be far, we’ll catch them.” 
Harry stood rooted to the spot as Filch and Snape came around 
the corner ahead. They couldn’t see him, of course, but it was a narrow corridor and if they came much nearer they’d knock right into 
him — the cloak didn’t stop him from being solid. 
He backed away as quietly as he could. A door stood ajar to his 
left. It was his only hope. He squeezed through it, holding his 
breath, trying not to move it, and to his relief he managed to get inside the room without their noticing anything. They walked 
straight past, and Harry leaned against the wall, breathing deeply, 
listening to their footsteps dying away. That had been close, very 
close. It was a few seconds before he noticed anything about the 
room he had hidden in. 
It looked like an unused classroom. The dark shapes of desks 
and chairs were piled against the walls, and there was an upturned 
wastepaper basket — but propped against the wall facing him 
was something that didn’t look as if it belonged there, something 
that looked as if someone had just put it there to keep it out of the 
way. 
It was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate 
gold frame, standing on two clawed feet. There was an inscription 
carved around the top: Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi. 
CHAPTER TWELVE 
 208 
His panic fading now that there was no sound of Filch and 
Snape, Harry moved nearer to the mirror, wanting to look at himself but see no reflection again. He stepped in front of it. 
He had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from 
screaming. He whirled around. His heart was pounding far more 
furiously than when the book had screamed — for he had seen not 
only himself in the mirror, but a whole crowd of people standing 
right behind him. 
But the room was empty. Breathing very fast, he turned slowly 
back to the mirror. 
There he was, reflected in it, white and scared-looking, and 
there, reflected behind him, were at least ten others. Harry looked 
over his shoulder — but still, no one was there. Or were they all invisible, too? Was he in fact in a room full of invisible people and 
this mirrors trick was that it reflected them, invisible or not? 
He looked in the mirror again. A woman standing right behind 
his reflection was smiling at him and waving. He reached out a 
hand and felt the air behind him. If she was really there, he’d touch 
her, their reflections were so close together, but he felt only air — 
she and the others existed only in the mirror. 
She was a very pretty woman. She had dark red hair and her 
eyes — her eyes are just like mine, Harry thought, edging a little 
closer to the glass. Bright green — exactly the same shape, but then 
he noticed that she was crying; smiling, but crying at the same 
time. The tall, thin, black-haired man standing next to her put his 
arm around her. He wore glasses, and his hair was very untidy. It 
stuck up at the back, just as Harry’s did. 
Harry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly 
touching that of his reflection. 
THE MIRROR OF ERISED 
 209 
“Mom?” he whispered. “Dad?” 
They just looked at him, smiling. And slowly, Harry looked into 
the faces of the other people in the mirror, and saw other pairs of 
green eyes like his, other noses like his, even a little old man who 
looked as though he had Harry’s knobbly knees — Harry was 
looking at his family, for the first time in his life. 
The Potters smiled and waved at Harry and he stared hungrily 
back at them, his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he 
was hoping to fall right through it and reach them. He had a powerful kind of ache inside him, half joy, half terrible sadness. 
How long he stood there, he didn’t know. The reflections did 
not fade and he looked and looked until a distant noise brought 
him back to his senses. He couldn’t stay here, he had to find his way 
back to bed. He tore his eyes away from his mother’s face, whispered, “I’ll come back,” and hurried from the room. 
“You could have woken me up,” said Ron, crossly. 
“You can come tonight, I’m going back, I want to show you the 
mirror.” 
“I’d like to see your mom and dad,” Ron said eagerly. 
“And I want to see all your family, all the Weasleys, you’ll be able 
to show me your other brothers and everyone.” 
“You can see them any old time,” said Ron. “Just come round 
my house this summer. Anyway, maybe it only shows dead people. 
Shame about not finding Flamel, though. Have some bacon or 
something, why aren’t you eating anything?” 
Harry couldn’t eat. He had seen his parents and would be seeing 
them again tonight. He had almost forgotten about Flamel. It 
didn’t seem very important anymore. Who cared what the three-
CHAPTER TWELVE 
 210 
headed dog was guarding? What did it matter if Snape stole it, 
really? 
“Are you all right?” said Ron. “You look odd.” 
What Harry feared most was that he might not be able to find the 
mirror room again. With Ron covered in the cloak, too, they had 
to walk much more slowly the next night. They tried retracing 
Harry’s route from the library, wandering around the dark passageways for nearly an hour. 
“I’m freezing,” said Ron. “Let’s forget it and go back.” 
“No!” Harry hissed. “I know it’s here somewhere.” 
They passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the opposite direction, but saw no one else. Just as Ron started moaning that his 
feet were dead with cold, Harry spotted the suit of armor. 
“It’s here — just here — yes!” 
They pushed the door open. Harry dropped the cloak from 
around his shoulders and ran to the mirror. 
There they were. His mother and father beamed at the sight of 
him. 
“See?” Harry whispered. 
“I can’t see anything.” 
“Look! Look at them all . . . there are loads of them. . . .” 
“I can only see you.” 
“Look in it properly, go on, stand where I am.” 
Harry stepped aside, but with Ron in front of the mirror, he 
couldn’t see his family anymore, just Ron in his paisley pajamas. 
Ron, though, was staring transfixed at his image. 
“Look at me!” he said. 
“Can you see all your family standing around you?” 
THE MIRROR OF ERISED 
 211 
“No — I’m alone — but I’m different — I look older — and I’m 
Head Boy!” 
“What?” 
“I am — I’m wearing the badge like Bill used to — and I’m 
holding the House Cup and the Quidditch Cup — I’m Quidditch 
captain, too!” 
Ron tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to look excitedly 
at Harry. 
“Do you think this mirror shows the future?” 
“How can it? All my family are dead — let me have another 
look —” 
“You had it to yourself all last night, give me a bit more time.” 
“You’re only holding the Quidditch Cup, what’s interesting 
about that? I want to see my parents.” 
“Don’t push me —” 
A sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to their discussion. They hadn’t realized how loudly they had been talking. 
“Quick!” 
Ron threw the cloak back over them as the luminous eyes of 
Mrs. Norris came round the door. Ron and Harry stood quite still, 
both thinking the same thing — did the cloak work on cats? After 
what seemed an age, she turned and left. 
“This isn’t safe — she might have gone for Filch, I bet she heard 
us. Come on.” 
And Ron pulled Harry out of the room. 
 
The snow still hadn’t melted the next morning. 
“Want to play chess, Harry?” said Ron. 
“No.” 
CHAPTER TWELVE 
 212 
“Why don’t we go down and visit Hagrid?” 
“No . . . you go . . .” 
“I know what you’re thinking about, Harry, that mirror. Don’t 
go back tonight.” 
“Why not?” 
“I dunno, I’ve just got a bad feeling about it — and anyway, 
you’ve had too many close shaves already. Filch, Snape, and Mrs. 
Norris are wandering around. So what if they can’t see you? What 
if they walk into you? What if you knock something over?” 
“You sound like Hermione.” 
“I’m serious, Harry, don’t go.” 
But Harry only had one thought in his head, which was to get 
back in front of the mirror, and Ron wasn’t going to stop him. 
That third night he found his way more quickly than before. He 
was walking so fast he knew he was making more noise than was 
wise, but he didn’t meet anyone. 
And there were his mother and father smiling at him again, and 
one of his grandfathers nodding happily. Harry sank down to sit on 
the floor in front of the mirror. There was nothing to stop him from 
staying here all night with his family. Nothing at all. 
Except — 
“So — back again, Harry?” 
Harry felt as though his insides had turned to ice. He looked behind him. Sitting on one of the desks by the wall was none other 
than Albus Dumbledore. Harry must have walked straight past 
him, so desperate to get to the mirror he hadn’t noticed him. 
“I — I didn’t see you, sir.” 
THE MIRROR OF ERISED 
 213 
“Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you,” said 
Dumbledore, and Harry was relieved to see that he was smiling. 
“So,” said Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor 
with Harry, “you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the 
delights of the Mirror of Erised.” 
“I didn’t know it was called that, sir.” 
“But I expect you’ve realized by now what it does?” 
“It — well — it shows me my family —” 
“And it showed your friend Ron himself as Head Boy.” 
“How did you know — ?” 
“I don’t need a cloak to become invisible,” said Dumbledore 
gently. “Now, can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us 
all?” 
Harry shook his head. 
“Let me explain. The happiest man on earth would be able to 
use the Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror, that is, he would look 
into it and see himself exactly as he is. Does that help?” 
Harry thought. Then he said slowly, “It shows us what we 
want . . . whatever we want . . .” 
“Yes and no,” said Dumbledore quietly. “It shows us nothing 
more or less than the deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts. 
You, who have never known your family, see them standing around 
you. Ronald Weasley, who has always been overshadowed by his 
brothers, sees himself standing alone, the best of all of them. However, this mirror will give us neither knowledge or truth. Men have 
wasted away before it, entranced by what they have seen, or been 
driven mad, not knowing if what it shows is real or even possible. 
“The Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow, Harry, 
CHAPTER TWELVE 
 214 
and I ask you not to go looking for it again. If you ever do run 
across it, you will now be prepared. It does not do to dwell on 
dreams and forget to live, remember that. Now, why don’t you put 
that admirable cloak back on and get off to bed?” 
Harry stood up. 
“Sir — Professor Dumbledore? Can I ask you something?” 
“Obviously, you’ve just done so,” Dumbledore smiled. “You may 
ask me one more thing, however.” 
“What do you see when you look in the mirror?” 
“I? I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks.” 
Harry stared. 
“One can never have enough socks,” said Dumbledore. “Another Christmas has come and gone and I didn’t get a single pair. 
People will insist on giving me books.” 
It was only when he was back in bed that it struck Harry that 
Dumbledore might not have been quite truthful. But then, he 
thought, as he shoved Scabbers off his pillow, it had been quite a 
personal question.

umbledore had convinced Harry not to go looking for the 
Mirror of Erised again, and for the rest of the Christmas 
holidays the Invisibility Cloak stayed folded at the bottom of his 
trunk. Harry wished he could forget what he’d seen in the mirror 
as easily, but he couldn’t. He started having nightmares. Over and 
over again he dreamed about his parents disappearing in a flash of 
green light, while a high voice cackled with laughter. 
“You see, Dumbledore was right, that mirror could drive you 
mad,” said Ron, when Harry told him about these dreams. 
Hermione, who came back the day before term started, took a 
different view of things. She was torn between horror at the idea of 
Harry being out of bed, roaming the school three nights in a row 
(“If Filch had caught you!”), and disappointment that he hadn’t at 
least found out who Nicolas Flamel was. 
They had almost given up hope of ever finding Flamel in a liD 
CHAPTER THIRTEEN 
 216 
brary book, even though Harry was still sure he’d read the name 
somewhere. Once term had started, they were back to skimming 
through books for ten minutes during their breaks. Harry had even 
less time than the other two, because Quidditch practice had 
started again. 
Wood was working the team harder than ever. Even the endless 
rain that had replaced the snow couldn’t dampen his spirits. The 
Weasleys complained that Wood was becoming a fanatic, but 
Harry was on Wood’s side. If they won their next match, against 
Hufflepuff, they would overtake Slytherin in the House Championship for the first time in seven years. Quite apart from wanting 
to win, Harry found that he had fewer nightmares when he was tired 
out after training. 
Then, during one particularly wet and muddy practice session, 
Wood gave the team a bit of bad news. He’d just gotten very angry 
with the Weasleys, who kept dive-bombing each other and pretending to fall off their brooms. 
“Will you stop messing around!” he yelled. “That’s exactly 
the sort of thing that’ll lose us the match! Snape’s refereeing this 
time, and he’ll be looking for any excuse to knock points off 
Gryffindor!” 
George Weasley really did fall off his broom at these words. 
“Snape’s refereeing?” he spluttered through a mouthful of mud. 
“When’s he ever refereed a Quidditch match? He’s not going to be 
fair if we might overtake Slytherin.” 
The rest of the team landed next to George to complain, too. 
“It’s not my fault,” said Wood. “We’ve just got to make sure we 
play a clean game, so Snape hasn’t got an excuse to pick on us.” 
NICHOLAS FLAMEL 
 217 
Which was all very well, thought Harry, but he had another reason for not wanting Snape near him while he was playing Quidditch. . . . 
The rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at 
the end of practice, but Harry headed straight back to the Gryffindor common room, where he found Ron and Hermione playing 
chess. Chess was the only thing Hermione ever lost at, something 
Harry and Ron thought was very good for her. 
“Don’t talk to me for a moment,” said Ron when Harry sat 
down next to him, “I need to concen-” He caught sight of 
Harry’s face. “What’s the matter with you? You look terrible.” 
Speaking quietly so that no one else would hear, Harry told the 
other two about Snape’s sudden, sinister desire to be a Quidditch 
referee. 
“Don’t play,” said Hermione at once. 
“Say you’re ill,” said Ron. 
“Pretend to break your leg,” Hermione suggested. 
“Really break your leg,” said Ron. 
“I can’t,” said Harry. “There isn’t a reserve Seeker. If I back out, 
Gryffindor can’t play at all.” 
At that moment Neville toppled into the common room. How 
he had managed to climb through the portrait hole was anyone’s 
guess, because his legs had been stuck together with what they 
recognized at once as the Leg-Locker Curse. He must have had to 
bunny hop all the way up to Gryffindor Tower. 
Everyone fell over laughing except Hermione, who leapt up and 
performed the countercurse. Neville’s legs sprang apart and he got 
to his feet, trembling. 
CHAPTER THIRTEEN 
 218 
“What happened?” Hermione asked him, leading him over to sit 
with Harry and Ron. 
“Malfoy,” said Neville shakily. “I met him outside the library. He 
said he’d been looking for someone to practice that on.” 
“Go to Professor McGonagall!” Hermione urged Neville. “Report him!” 
Neville shook his head. 
“I don’t want more trouble,” he mumbled. 
“You’ve got to stand up to him, Neville!” said Ron. “He’s used to 
walking all over people, but that’s no reason to lie down in front of 
him and make it easier.” 
“There’s no need to tell me I’m not brave enough to be in 
Gryffindor, Malfoy’s already done that,” Neville choked out. 
Harry felt in the pocket of his robes and pulled out a Chocolate 
Frog, the very last one from the box Hermione had given him for 
Christmas. He gave it to Neville, who looked as though he might 
cry. 
“You’re worth twelve of Malfoy,” Harry said. “The Sorting Hat 
chose you for Gryffindor, didn’t it? And where’s Malfoy? In stinking Slytherin.” 
Neville’s lips twitched in a weak smile as he unwrapped the frog. 
“Thanks, Harry . . . I think I’ll go to bed. . . . D’you want the 
card, you collect them, don’t you?” 
As Neville walked away, Harry looked at the Famous Wizard 
card. 
“Dumbledore again,” he said, “He was the first one I ever —” 
He gasped. He stared at the back of the card. Then he looked up 
at Ron and Hermione. 
NICHOLAS FLAMEL 
 219 
“I’ve found him!” he whispered. “I’ve found Flamel! I told you I’d 
read the name somewhere before, I read it on the train coming 
here — listen to this: ‘Dumbledore is particularly famous for his 
defeat of the Dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery 
of the twelve uses of dragon’s blood, and his work on alchemy with 
his partner, Nicolas Flamel’!” 
Hermione jumped to her feet. She hadn’t looked so excited 
since they’d gotten back the marks for their very first piece of 
homework. 
“Stay there!” she said, and she sprinted up the stairs to the girls’ 
dormitories. Harry and Ron barely had time to exchange mystified 
looks before she was dashing back, an enormous old book in her 
arms. 
“I never thought to look in here!” she whispered excitedly. “I got 
this out of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading.” 
“Light?” said Ron, but Hermione told him to be quiet until she’d 
looked something up, and started flicking frantically through the 
pages, muttering to herself. 
At last she found what she was looking for. 
“I knew it! I knew it!” 
“Are we allowed to speak yet?” said Ron grumpily. Hermione ignored him. 
“Nicolas Flamel,” she whispered dramatically, “is the only known 
maker of the Sorcerer’s Stone!” 
This didn’t have quite the effect she’d expected. 
“The what?” said Harry and Ron. 
“Oh, honestly, don’t you two read? Look — read that, there.” 
She pushed the book toward them, and Harry and Ron read: 
CHAPTER THIRTEEN 
 220 
The ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the Sorcerer’s Stone, a legendary substance with astonishing powers. The Stone will transform any metal 
into pure gold. It also produces the Elixir of Life, 
which will make the drinker immortal.
There have been many reports of the Sorcerer’s 
Stone over the centuries, but the only Stone currently 
in existence belongs to Mr. Nicolas Flamel, the noted 
alchemist and opera lover. Mr. Flamel, who celebrated his six hundred and sixty-fifth birthday last 
year, enjoys a quiet life in Devon with his wife, 
Perenelle (six hundred and fifty-eight).
“See?” said Hermione, when Harry and Ron had finished. “The 
dog must be guarding Flamel’s Sorcerer’s Stone! I bet he asked 
Dumbledore to keep it safe for him, because they’re friends and he 
knew someone was after it, that’s why he wanted the Stone moved 
out of Gringotts!” 
“A stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying!” said 
Harry. “No wonder Snape’s after it! Anyone would want it.” 
“And no wonder we couldn’t find Flamel in that Study of Recent 
Developments in Wizardry,” said Ron. “He’s not exactly recent if he’s 
six hundred and sixty-five, is he?” 
The next morning in Defense Against the Dark Arts, while copying down different ways of treating werewolf bites, Harry and Ron 
were still discussing what they’d do with a Sorcerer’s Stone if they 
had one. It wasn’t until Ron said he’d buy his own Quidditch team 
that Harry remembered about Snape and the coming match. 
NICHOLAS FLAMEL 
 221 
“I’m going to play,” he told Ron and Hermione. “If I don’t, all 
the Slytherins will think I’m just too scared to face Snape. I’ll show 
them . . . it’ll really wipe the smiles off their faces if we win.” 
“Just as long as we’re not wiping you off the field,” said Hermione. 
As the match drew nearer, however, Harry became more and more 
nervous, whatever he told Ron and Hermione. The rest of the team 
wasn’t too calm, either. The idea of overtaking Slytherin in the 
House Championship was wonderful, no one had done it for seven 
years, but would they be allowed to, with such a biased referee? 
Harry didn’t know whether he was imagining it or not, but he 
seemed to keep running into Snape wherever he went. At times, he 
even wondered whether Snape was following him, trying to catch 
him on his own. Potions lessons were turning into a sort of weekly 
torture, Snape was so horrible to Harry. Could Snape possibly 
know they’d found out about the Sorcerer’s Stone? Harry didn’t see 
how he could — yet he sometimes had the horrible feeling that 
Snape could read minds. 
Harry knew, when they wished him good luck outside the locker 
rooms the next afternoon, that Ron and Hermione were wondering whether they’d ever see him alive again. This wasn’t what you’d 
call comforting. Harry hardly heard a word of Wood’s pep talk as 
he pulled on his Quidditch robes and picked up his Nimbus Two 
Thousand. 
Ron and Hermione, meanwhile, had found a place in the stands 
next to Neville, who couldn’t understand why they looked so grim 
and worried, or why they had both brought their wands to the 
CHAPTER THIRTEEN 
 222 
match. Little did Harry know that Ron and Hermione had been 
secretly practicing the Leg-Locker Curse. They’d gotten the idea 
from Malfoy using it on Neville, and were ready to use it on Snape 
if he showed any sign of wanting to hurt Harry. 
“Now, don’t forget, it’s Locomotor Mortis,” Hermione muttered as 
Ron slipped his wand up his sleeve. 
“I know,” Ron snapped. “Don’t nag.” 
Back in the locker room, Wood had taken Harry aside. 
“Don’t want to pressure you, Potter, but if we ever need an early 
capture of the Snitch it’s now. Finish the game before Snape can favor Hufflepuff too much.” 
“The whole school’s out there!” said Fred Weasley, peering out of 
the door. “Even — blimey — Dumbledore’s come to watch!” 
Harry’s heart did a somersault. 
“Dumbledore?” he said, dashing to the door to make sure. Fred 
was right. There was no mistaking that silver beard. 
Harry could have laughed out loud with relief. He was safe. 
There was simply no way that Snape would dare to try to hurt him 
if Dumbledore was watching. 
Perhaps that was why Snape was looking so angry as the teams 
marched onto the field, something that Ron noticed, too. 
“I’ve never seen Snape look so mean,” he told Hermione. 
“Look — they’re off. Ouch!” 
Someone had poked Ron in the back of the head. It was Malfoy. 
“Oh, sorry, Weasley, didn’t see you there.” 
Malfoy grinned broadly at Crabbe and Goyle. 
“Wonder how long Potter’s going to stay on his broom this time? 
Anyone want a bet? What about you, Weasley?” 
NICHOLAS FLAMEL 
 223 
Ron didn’t answer; Snape had just awarded Hufflepuff a penalty 
because George Weasley had hit a Bludger at him. Hermione, who 
had all her fingers crossed in her lap, was squinting fixedly at Harry, 
who was circling the game like a hawk, looking for the Snitch. 
“You know how I think they choose people for the Gryffindor 
team?” said Malfoy loudly a few minutes later, as Snape awarded 
Hufflepuff another penalty for no reason at all. “It’s people they 
feel sorry for. See, there’s Potter, who’s got no parents, then there’s 
the Weasleys, who’ve got no money — you should be on the team, 
Longbottom, you’ve got no brains.” 
Neville went bright red but turned in his seat to face Malfoy. 
“I’m worth twelve of you, Malfoy,” he stammered. 
Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle howled with laughter, but Ron, still 
not daring to take his eyes from the game, said, “You tell him, 
Neville.” 
“Longbottom, if brains were gold you’d be poorer than Weasley, 
and that’s saying something.” 
Ron’s nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with 
anxiety about Harry. 
“I’m warning you, Malfoy — one more word —” 
“Ron!” said Hermione suddenly, “Harry — !” 
“What? Where?” 
Harry had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive, which drew 
gasps and cheers from the crowd. Hermione stood up, her crossed 
fingers in her mouth, as Harry streaked toward the ground like a 
bullet. 
“You’re in luck, Weasley, Potter’s obviously spotted some money 
on the ground!” said Malfoy. 
CHAPTER THIRTEEN 
 224 
Ron snapped. Before Malfoy knew what was happening, Ron 
was on top of him, wrestling him to the ground. Neville hesitated, 
then clambered over the back of his seat to help. 
“Come on, Harry!” Hermione screamed, leaping onto her seat 
to watch as Harry sped straight at Snape — she didn’t even notice 
Malfoy and Ron rolling around under her seat, or the scuffles and 
yelps coming from the whirl of fists that was Neville, Crabbe, and 
Goyle. 
Up in the air, Snape turned on his broomstick just in time to see 
something scarlet shoot past him, missing him by inches — the 
next second, Harry had pulled out of the dive, his arm raised in triumph, the Snitch clasped in his hand. 
The stands erupted; it had to be a record, no one could ever remember the Snitch being caught so quickly. 
“Ron! Ron! Where are you? The game’s over! Harry’s won! We’ve 
won! Gryffindor is in the lead!” shrieked Hermione, dancing 
up and down on her seat and hugging Parvati Patil in the row in 
front. 
Harry jumped off his broom, a foot from the ground. He 
couldn’t believe it. He’d done it — the game was over; it had barely 
lasted five minutes. As Gryffindors came spilling onto the field, he 
saw Snape land nearby, white-faced and tight-lipped — then 
Harry felt a hand on his shoulder and looked up into Dumbledore’s smiling face. 
“Well done,” said Dumbledore quietly, so that only Harry could 
hear. “Nice to see you haven’t been brooding about that mirror . . . 
been keeping busy . . . excellent . . .” 
Snape spat bitterly on the ground.
  
NICHOLAS FLAMEL 
 225 
Harry left the locker room alone some time later, to take his Nimbus Two Thousand back to the broomshed. He couldn’t ever remember feeling happier. He’d really done something to be proud of 
now — no one could say he was just a famous name any more. The 
evening air had never smelled so sweet. He walked over the damp 
grass, reliving the last hour in his head, which was a happy blur: 
Gryffindors running to lift him onto their shoulders; Ron and 
Hermione in the distance, jumping up and down, Ron cheering 
through a heavy nosebleed. 
Harry had reached the shed. He leaned against the wooden door 
and looked up at Hogwarts, with its windows glowing red in the 
setting sun. Gryffindor in the lead. He’d done it, he’d shown 
Snape. . . . 
And speaking of Snape . . . 
A hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of the castle. 
Clearly not wanting to be seen, it walked as fast as possible toward 
the forbidden forest. Harry’s victory faded from his mind as he 
watched. He recognized the figure’s prowling walk. Snape, sneaking into the forest while everyone else was at dinner — what was 
going on? 
Harry jumped back on his Nimbus Two Thousand and took off. 
Gliding silently over the castle he saw Snape enter the forest at a 
run. He followed. 
The trees were so thick he couldn’t see where Snape had gone. 
He flew in circles, lower and lower, brushing the top branches of 
trees until he heard voices. He glided toward them and landed 
noiselessly in a towering beech tree. 
He climbed carefully along one of the branches, holding tight to 
his broomstick, trying to see through the leaves. 
CHAPTER THIRTEEN

Below, in a shadowy clearing, stood Snape, but he wasn’t alone. 
Quirrell was there, too. Harry couldn’t make out the look on his 
face, but he was stuttering worse than ever. Harry strained to catch 
what they were saying. 
“. . . d-don’t know why you wanted t-t-to meet here of all 
p-places, Severus . . .” 
“Oh, I thought we’d keep this private,” said Snape, his voice 
icy. “Students aren’t supposed to know about the Sorcerer’s Stone, 
after all.” 
Harry leaned forward. Quirrell was mumbling something. 
Snape interrupted him. 
“Have you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid’s yet?” 
“B-b-but Severus, I —” 
“You don’t want me as your enemy, Quirrell,” said Snape, taking 
a step toward him. 
“I-I don’t know what you —” 
“You know perfectly well what I mean.” 
An owl hooted loudly, and Harry nearly fell out of the tree. He 
steadied himself in time to hear Snape say, “— your little bit of 
hocus-pocus. I’m waiting.” 
“B-but I d-d-don’t —” 
“Very well,” Snape cut in. “We’ll have another little chat soon, 
when you’ve had time to think things over and decided where your 
loyalties lie.” 
He threw his cloak over his head and strode out of the clearing. 
It was almost dark now, but Harry could see Quirrell, standing 
quite still as though he was petrified.

“Harry, where have you been?” Hermione squeaked. 
“We won! You won! We won!” shouted Ron, thumping Harry 
on the back. “And I gave Malfoy a black eye, and Neville tried to 
take on Crabbe and Goyle single-handed! He’s still out cold but 
Madam Pomfrey says he’ll be all right — talk about showing 
Slytherin! Everyone’s waiting for you in the common room, we’re 
having a party, Fred and George stole some cakes and stuff from 
the kitchens.” 
“Never mind that now,” said Harry breathlessly. “Let’s find an 
empty room, you wait ’til you hear this. . . .” 
He made sure Peeves wasn’t inside before shutting the door behind them, then he told them what he’d seen and heard. 
“So we were right, it is the Sorcerer’s Stone, and Snape’s trying to 
force Quirrell to help him get it. He asked if he knew how to get 
past Fluffy — and he said something about Quirrell’s ‘hocuspocus’ — I reckon there are other things guarding the stone apart 
from Fluffy, loads of enchantments, probably, and Quirrell would 
have done some anti-Dark Arts spell that Snape needs to break 
through —” 
“So you mean the Stone’s only safe as long as Quirrell stands up 
to Snape?” said Hermione in alarm. 
“It’ll be gone by next Tuesday,” said Ron.

uirrell, however, must have been braver than they’d 
thought. In the weeks that followed he did seem to be getting paler and thinner, but it didn’t look as though he’d cracked yet. 
Every time they passed the third-floor corridor, Harry, Ron, and 
Hermione would press their ears to the door to check that Fluffy 
was still growling inside. Snape was sweeping about in his usual 
bad temper, which surely meant that the Stone was still safe. 
Whenever Harry passed Quirrell these days he gave him an encouraging sort of smile, and Ron had started telling people off for 
laughing at Quirrell’s stutter. 
Hermione, however, had more on her mind than the Sorcerer’s 
Stone. She had started drawing up study schedules and colorcoding all her notes. Harry and Ron wouldn’t have minded, but 
she kept nagging them to do the same. 
“Hermione, the exams are ages away.” 
Q 
NORBERT THE 
NORWEGIAN RIDGEBACK 
 229 
“Ten weeks,” Hermione snapped. “That’s not ages, that’s like a 
second to Nicolas Flamel.” 
“But we’re not six hundred years old,” Ron reminded her. “Anyway, what are you studying for, you already know it all.” 
“What am I studying for? Are you crazy? You realize we need to 
pass these exams to get into the second year? They’re very important, I should have started studying a month ago, I don’t know 
what’s gotten into me. 
Unfortunately, the teachers seemed to be thinking along the 
same lines as Hermione. They piled so much homework on them 
that the Easter holidays weren’t nearly as much fun as the Christmas ones. It was hard to relax with Hermione next to you reciting the 
twelve uses of dragon’s blood or practicing wand movements. Moaning and yawning, Harry and Ron spent most of their free time in 
the library with her, trying to get through all their extra work. 
“I’ll never remember this,” Ron burst out one afternoon, throwing down his quill and looking longingly out of the library window. It was the first really fine day they’d had in months. The sky 
was a clear, forget-me-not blue, and there was a feeling in the air of 
summer coming. 
Harry, who was looking up “Dittany” in One Thousand Magical 
Herbs and Fungi, didn’t look up until he heard Ron say, “Hagrid! 
What are you doing in the library?” 
Hagrid shuffled into view, hiding something behind his back. 
He looked very out of place in his moleskin overcoat. 
“Jus’ lookin’,” he said, in a shifty voice that got their interest at 
once. “An’ what’re you lot up ter?” He looked suddenly suspicious. 
“Yer not still lookin’ fer Nicolas Flamel, are yeh?” 
CHAPTER FOURTEEN 
 230 
“Oh, we found out who he is ages ago,” said Ron impressively. 
“And we know what that dog’s guarding, it’s a Sorcerer’s St —” 
“Shhhh!” Hagrid looked around quickly to see if anyone was listening. “Don’ go shoutin’ about it, what’s the matter with yeh?” 
“There are a few things we wanted to ask you, as a matter of 
fact,” said Harry, “about what’s guarding the Stone apart from 
Fluffy —” 
“SHHHH!” said Hagrid again. “Listen — come an’ see me later, 
I’m not promisin’ I’ll tell yeh anythin’, mind, but don’ go rabbitin’ 
about it in here, students aren’ s’pposed ter know. They’ll think I’ve 
told yeh —” 
“See you later, then,” said Harry. 
Hagrid shuffled off. 
“What was he hiding behind his back?” said Hermione thoughtfully. 
“Do you think it had anything to do with the Stone?” 
“I’m going to see what section he was in,” said Ron, who’d had 
enough of working. He came back a minute later with a pile of 
books in his arms and slammed them down on the table. 
“Dragons!” he whispered. “Hagrid was looking up stuff about 
dragons! Look at these: Dragon Species of Great Britain and Ireland; 
From Egg to Inferno, A Dragon Keeper’s Guide.” 
“Hagrid’s always wanted a dragon, he told me so the first time I 
ever met him,” said Harry. 
“But it’s against our laws,” said Ron. “Dragon breeding was outlawed by the Warlocks’ Convention of 1709, everyone knows that. 
It’s hard to stop Muggles from noticing us if we’re keeping dragons 
in the back garden — anyway, you can’t tame dragons, it’s dan- 
NORBERT THE 
NORWEGIAN RIDGEBACK 
 231 
gerous. You should see the burns Charlie’s got off wild ones in Romania.” 
“But there aren’t wild dragons in Britain?” said Harry. 
“Of course there are,” said Ron. “Common Welsh Green and 
Hebridean Blacks. The Ministry of Magic has a job hushing them 
up, I can tell you. Our kind have to keep putting spells on Muggles 
who’ve spotted them, to make them forget.” 
“So what on earth’s Hagrid up to?” said Hermione. 
When they knocked on the door of the gamekeeper’s hut an hour 
later, they were surprised to see that all the curtains were closed. 
Hagrid called “Who is it?” before he let them in, and then shut the 
door quickly behind them. 
It was stifling hot inside. Even though it was such a warm day, 
there was a blazing fire in the grate. Hagrid made them tea and offered them stoat sandwiches, which they refused. 
“So — yeh wanted to ask me somethin’?” 
“Yes,” said Harry. There was no point beating around the bush. 
“We were wondering if you could tell us what’s guarding the 
Sorcerer’s Stone apart from Fluffy.” 
Hagrid frowned at him. 
“O’ course I can’t,” he said. “Number one, I don’ know meself. 
Number two, yeh know too much already, so I wouldn’ tell yeh if I 
could. That Stone’s here fer a good reason. It was almost stolen 
outta Gringotts — I s’ppose yeh’ve worked that out an’ all? Beats 
me how yeh even know abou’ Fluffy.” 
“Oh, come on, Hagrid, you might not want to tell us, but you 
do know, you know everything that goes on round here,” said 
CHAPTER FOURTEEN 
 232 
Hermione in a warm, flattering voice. Hagrid’s beard twitched 
and they could tell he was smiling. “We only wondered who had 
done the guarding, really.” Hermione went on. “We wondered who 
Dumbledore had trusted enough to help him, apart from you.” 
Hagrid’s chest swelled at these last words. Harry and Ron 
beamed at Hermione. 
“Well, I don’ s’pose it could hurt ter tell yeh that . . . let’s see . . . 
he borrowed Fluffy from me . . . then some o’ the teachers did 
enchantments . . . Professor Sprout — Professor Flitwick — Professor McGonagall —” he ticked them off on his fingers, “Professor Quirrell — an’ Dumbledore himself did somethin’, o’ course. 
Hang on, I’ve forgotten someone. Oh yeah, Professor Snape.” 
“Snape?” 
“Yeah — yer not still on abou’ that, are yeh? Look, Snape helped 
protect the Stone, he’s not about ter steal it.” 
Harry knew Ron and Hermione were thinking the same as he 
was. If Snape had been in on protecting the Stone, it must have 
been easy to find out how the other teachers had guarded it. He 
probably knew everything — except, it seemed, Quirrell’s spell and 
how to get past Fluffy. 
“You’re the only one who knows how to get past Fluffy, aren’t 
you, Hagrid?” said Harry anxiously. “And you wouldn’t tell anyone, would you? Not even one of the teachers?” 
“Not a soul knows except me an’ Dumbledore,” said Hagrid 
proudly. 
“Well, that’s something,” Harry muttered to the others. “Hagrid, can we have a window open? I’m boiling.” 
“Can’t, Harry, sorry,” said Hagrid. Harry noticed him glance at 
the fire. Harry looked at it, too. 
NORBERT THE 
NORWEGIAN RIDGEBACK 
 233 
“Hagrid — what’s that?” 
But he already knew what it was. In the very heart of the fire, underneath the kettle, was a huge, black egg. 
“Ah,” said Hagrid, fiddling nervously with his beard, “That’s — 
er . . .” 
“Where did you get it, Hagrid?” said Ron, crouching over 
the fire to get a closer look at the egg. “It must’ve cost you a fortune.” 
“Won it,” said Hagrid. “Las’ night. I was down in the village 
havin’ a few drinks an’ got into a game o’ cards with a stranger. 
Think he was quite glad ter get rid of it, ter be honest.” 
“But what are you going to do with it when it’s hatched?” said 
Hermione. 
“Well, I’ve bin doin’ some readin’,” said Hagrid, pulling a large 
book from under his pillow. “Got this outta the library — Dragon 
Breeding for Pleasure and Profit — it’s a bit outta date, o’ course, but 
it’s all in here. Keep the egg in the fire, ’cause their mothers breathe 
on ’em, see, an’ when it hatches, feed it on a bucket o’ brandy 
mixed with chicken blood every half hour. An’ see here — how ter 
recognize diff’rent eggs — what I got there’s a Norwegian Ridgeback. They’re rare, them.” 
He looked very pleased with himself, but Hermione didn’t. 
“Hagrid, you live in a wooden house,” she said. 
But Hagrid wasn’t listening. He was humming merrily as he 
stoked the fire. 
So now they had something else to worry about: what might happen to Hagrid if anyone found out he was hiding an illegal dragon 
in his hut. 
CHAPTER FOURTEEN 
 234 
“Wonder what it’s like to have a peaceful life,” Ron sighed, as 
evening after evening they struggled through all the extra homework they were getting. Hermione had now started making study 
schedules for Harry and Ron, too. It was driving them nuts. 
Then, one breakfast time, Hedwig brought Harry another note 
from Hagrid. He had written only two words: It’s hatching.
Ron wanted to skip Herbology and go straight down to the hut. 
Hermione wouldn’t hear of it. 
“Hermione, how many times in our lives are we going to see a 
dragon hatching?” 
“We’ve got lessons, we’ll get into trouble, and that’s nothing to 
what Hagrid’s going to be in when someone finds out what he’s doing —” 
“Shut up!” Harry whispered. 
Malfoy was only a few feet away and he had stopped dead to listen. How much had he heard? Harry didn’t like the look on Malfoy’s face at all. 
Ron and Hermione argued all the way to Herbology and in the 
end, Hermione agreed to run down to Hagrid’s with the other two 
during morning break. When the bell sounded from the castle at 
the end of their lesson, the three of them dropped their trowels at 
once and hurried through the grounds to the edge of the forest. 
Hagrid greeted them, looking flushed and excited. 
“It’s nearly out.” He ushered them inside. 
The egg was lying on the table. There were deep cracks in it. Something was moving inside; a funny clicking noise was coming from it. 
They all drew their chairs up to the table and watched with 
bated breath. 
NORBERT THE 
NORWEGIAN RIDGEBACK 
 235 
All at once there was a scraping noise and the egg split open. 
The baby dragon flopped onto the table. It wasn’t exactly pretty; 
Harry thought it looked like a crumpled, black umbrella. Its spiny 
wings were huge compared to its skinny jet body, it had a long 
snout with wide nostrils, the stubs of horns and bulging, orange 
eyes. 
It sneezed. A couple of sparks flew out of its snout. 
“Isn’t he beautiful?” Hagrid murmured. He reached out a hand 
to stroke the dragon’s head. It snapped at his fingers, showing 
pointed fangs. 
“Bless him, look, he knows his mommy!” said Hagrid. 
“Hagrid,” said Hermione, “how fast do Norwegian Ridgebacks 
grow, exactly?” 
Hagrid was about to answer when the color suddenly drained 
from his face — he leapt to his feet and ran to the window. 
“What’s the matter?” 
“Someone was lookin’ through the gap in the curtains — it’s a 
kid — he’s runnin’ back up ter the school.” 
Harry bolted to the door and looked out. Even at a distance there 
was no mistaking him. 
Malfoy had seen the dragon. 
Something about the smile lurking on Malfoy’s face during the 
next week made Harry, Ron, and Hermione very nervous. They 
spent most of their free time in Hagrid’s darkened hut, trying to 
reason with him. 
“Just let him go,” Harry urged. “Set him free.” 
“I can’t,” said Hagrid. “He’s too little. He’d die.” 
CHAPTER FOURTEEN 
 236 
They looked at the dragon. It had grown three times in length in 
just a week. Smoke kept furling out of its nostrils. Hagrid hadn’t 
been doing his gamekeeping duties because the dragon was keeping him so busy. There were empty brandy bottles and chicken 
feathers all over the floor. 
“I’ve decided to call him Norbert,” said Hagrid, looking at the 
dragon with misty eyes. “He really knows me now, watch. Norbert! 
Norbert! Where’s Mommy?” 
“He’s lost his marbles,” Ron muttered in Harry’s ear. 
“Hagrid,” said Harry loudly, “give it two weeks and Norbert’s 
going to be as long as your house. Malfoy could go to Dumbledore 
at any moment.” 
Hagrid bit his lip. 
“I — I know I can’t keep him forever, but I can’t jus’ dump him, 
can’t.” 
Harry suddenly turned to Ron. 
“Charlie,” he said. 
“You’re losing it, too,” said Ron. “I’m Ron, remember?” 
“No — Charlie — your brother, Charlie. In Romania. Studying 
dragons. We could send Norbert to him. Charlie can take care of 
him and then put him back in the wild!” 
“Brilliant!” said Ron. “How about it, Hagrid?” 
And in the end, Hagrid agreed that they could send an owl to 
Charlie to ask him. 
The following week dragged by. Wednesday night found Hermione and Harry sitting alone in the common room, long after 
everyone else had gone to bed. The clock on the wall had just 
NORBERT THE 
NORWEGIAN RIDGEBACK 
 237 
chimed midnight when the portrait hole burst open. Ron appeared 
out of nowhere as he pulled off Harry’s Invisibility Cloak. He had 
been down at Hagrid’s hut, helping him feed Norbert, who was 
now eating dead rats by the crate. 
“It bit me!” he said, showing them his hand, which was wrapped 
in a bloody handkerchief. “I’m not going to be able to hold a quill 
for a week. I tell you, that dragon’s the most horrible animal I’ve 
ever met, but the way Hagrid goes on about it, you’d think it was a 
fluffy little bunny rabbit. When it bit me he told me off for frightening it. And when I left, he was singing it a lullaby.” 
There was a tap on the dark window. 
“It’s Hedwig!” said Harry, hurrying to let her in. “She’ll have 
Charlie’s answer!” 
The three of them put their heads together to read the note. 
Dear Ron, 
How are you? Thanks for the letter — I’d be glad to take 
the Norwegian Ridgeback, but it won’t be easy getting him 
here. I think the best thing will be to send him over with 
some friends of mine who are coming to visit me next week. 
Trouble is, they mustn’t be seen carrying an illegal dragon. 
Could you get the Ridgeback up the tallest tower at midnight on Saturday? They can meet you there and take him 
away while it’s still dark. 
Send me an answer as soon as possible. 
Love, 
Charlie 
CHAPTER FOURTEEN 
 238 
They looked at one another. 
“We’ve got the Invisibility Cloak,” said Harry. “It shouldn’t be 
too difficult — I think the cloak’s big enough to cover two of us 
and Norbert.” 
It was a mark of how bad the last week had been that the other two 
agreed with him. Anything to get rid of Norbert — and Malfoy. 
There was a hitch. By the next morning, Ron’s bitten hand had 
swollen to twice its usual size. He didn’t know whether it was safe 
to go to Madam Pomfrey — would she recognize a dragon bite? By 
the afternoon, though, he had no choice. The cut had turned a 
nasty shade of green. It looked as if Norbert’s fangs were poisonous. 
Harry and Hermione rushed up to the hospital wing at the end 
of the day to find Ron in a terrible state in bed. 
“It’s not just my hand,” he whispered, “although that feels like 
it’s about to fall off. Malfoy told Madam Pomfrey he wanted to 
borrow one of my books so he could come and have a good laugh 
at me. He kept threatening to tell her what really bit me — I’ve 
told her it was a dog, but I don’t think she believes me — I 
shouldn’t have hit him at the Quidditch match, that’s why he’s doing this.” 
Harry and Hermione tried to calm Ron down. 
“It’ll all be over at midnight on Saturday,” said Hermione, but 
this didn’t soothe Ron at all. On the contrary, he sat bolt upright 
and broke into a sweat. 
“Midnight on Saturday!” he said in a hoarse voice. “Oh no — 
oh no — I’ve just remembered — Charlie’s letter was in that book 
Malfoy took, he’s going to know we’re getting rid of Norbert.” 
NORBERT THE 
NORWEGIAN RIDGEBACK 
 239 
Harry and Hermione didn’t get a chance to answer. Madam 
Pomfrey came over at that moment and made them leave, saying 
Ron needed sleep. 
“It’s too late to change the plan now,” Harry told Hermione. “We 
haven’t got time to send Charlie another owl, and this could be our 
only chance to get rid of Norbert. We’ll have to risk it. And we have 
got the Invisibility Cloak, Malfoy doesn’t know about that.” 
They found Fang the boarhound sitting outside with a bandaged tail when they went to tell Hagrid, who opened a window to 
talk to them. 
“I won’t let you in,” he puffed. “Norbert’s at a tricky stage — 
nothin’ I can’t handle.” 
When they told him about Charlie’s letter, his eyes filled with 
tears, although that might have been because Norbert had just bitten him on the leg. 
“Aargh! It’s all right, he only got my boot — jus’ playin’ — he’s 
only a baby, after all.” 
The baby banged its tail on the wall, making the windows rattle. 
Harry and Hermione walked back to the castle feeling Saturday 
couldn’t come quickly enough. 
They would have felt sorry for Hagrid when the time came for him 
to say good-bye to Norbert if they hadn’t been so worried about 
what they had to do. It was a very dark, cloudy night, and they 
were a bit late arriving at Hagrid’s hut because they’d had to wait 
for Peeves to get out of their way in the entrance hall, where he’d 
been playing tennis against the wall. 
CHAPTER FOURTEEN 
 240 
Hagrid had Norbert packed and ready in a large crate. 
“He’s got lots o’ rats an’ some brandy fer the journey,” said Hagrid in a muffled voice. “An’ I’ve packed his teddy bear in case he 
gets lonely.” 
From inside the crate came ripping noises that sounded to Harry 
as though the teddy was having his head torn off. 
“Bye-bye, Norbert!” Hagrid sobbed, as Harry and Hermione 
covered the crate with the Invisibility Cloak and stepped underneath it themselves. “Mommy will never forget you!” 
How they managed to get the crate back up to the castle, they 
never knew. Midnight ticked nearer as they heaved Norbert up the 
marble staircase in the entrance hall and along the dark corridors. 
Up another staircase, then another — even one of Harry’s shortcuts didn’t make the work much easier. 
“Nearly there!” Harry panted as they reached the corridor beneath the tallest tower. 
Then a sudden movement ahead of them made them almost 
drop the crate. Forgetting that they were already invisible, they 
shrank into the shadows, staring at the dark outlines of two people 
grappling with each other ten feet away. A lamp flared. 
Professor McGonagall, in a tartan bathrobe and a hair net, had 
Malfoy by the ear. 
“Detention!” she shouted. “And twenty points from Slytherin! 
Wandering around in the middle of the night, how dare you —” 
“You don’t understand, Professor. Harry Potter’s coming — he’s 
got a dragon!” 
“What utter rubbish! How dare you tell such lies! Come on — I 
shall see Professor Snape about you, Malfoy!” 
NORBERT THE 
NORWEGIAN RIDGEBACK 
 241 
The steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower seemed the 
easiest thing in the world after that. Not until they’d stepped out 
into the cold night air did they throw off the cloak, glad to be able 
to breathe properly again. Hermione did a sort of jig. 
“Malfoy’s got detention! I could sing!” 
“Don’t,” Harry advised her. 
Chuckling about Malfoy, they waited, Norbert thrashing about 
in his crate. About ten minutes later, four broomsticks came swooping down out of the darkness. 
Charlie’s friends were a cheery lot. They showed Harry and 
Hermione the harness they’d rigged up, so they could suspend 
Norbert between them. They all helped buckle Norbert safely into 
it and then Harry and Hermione shook hands with the others and 
thanked them very much. 
At last, Norbert was going . . . going . . . gone.
They slipped back down the spiral staircase, their hearts as light 
as their hands, now that Norbert was off them. No more dragon — 
Malfoy in detention — what could spoil their happiness? 
The answer to that was waiting at the foot of the stairs. As they 
stepped into the corridor, Filch’s face loomed suddenly out of the 
darkness. 
“Well, well, well,” he whispered, “we are in trouble.” 
They’d left the Invisibility Cloak on top of the tower. 
C H A P T E R F I F T E E N 
 242 
THE FORBIDDEN FOREST 
hings couldn’t have been worse. 
Filch took them down to Professor McGonagall’s study 
on the first floor, where they sat and waited without saying a word 
to each other. Hermione was trembling. Excuses, alibis, and wild 
cover-up stories chased each other around Harry’s brain, each more 
feeble than the last. He couldn’t see how they were going to get out 
of trouble this time. They were cornered. How could they have 
been so stupid as to forget the cloak? There was no reason on earth 
that Professor McGonagall would accept for their being out of bed 
and creeping around the school in the dead of night, let alone being up the tallest Astronomy Tower, which was out-of-bounds except for classes. Add Norbert and the Invisibility Cloak, and they 
might as well be packing their bags already. 
Had Harry thought that things couldn’t have been worse? He 
was wrong. When Professor McGonagall appeared, she was leading 
Neville. 
T 
THE FORBIDDEN FOREST 
 243 
“Harry!” Neville burst out, the moment he saw the other two. “I 
was trying to find you to warn you, I heard Malfoy saying he was 
going to catch you, he said you had a drag —” 
Harry shook his head violently to shut Neville up, but Professor 
McGonagall had seen. She looked more likely to breathe fire than 
Norbert as she towered over the three of them. 
“I would never have believed it of any of you. Mr. Filch says you 
were up in the Astronomy Tower. It’s one o’clock in the morning. 
Explain yourselves.” 
It was the first time Hermione had ever failed to answer a 
teacher’s question. She was staring at her slippers, as still as a statue. 
“I think I’ve got a good idea of what’s been going on,” said Professor McGonagall. “It doesn’t take a genius to work it out. You fed 
Draco Malfoy some cock-and-bull story about a dragon, trying to 
get him out of bed and into trouble. I’ve already caught him. I suppose you think it’s funny that Longbottom here heard the story and 
believed it, too?” 
Harry caught Neville’s eye and tried to tell him without words 
that this wasn’t true, because Neville was looking stunned and hurt. 
Poor, blundering Neville — Harry knew what it must have cost 
him to try and find them in the dark, to warn them. 
“I’m disgusted,” said Professor McGonagall. “Four students out 
of bed in one night! I’ve never heard of such a thing before! You, 
Miss Granger, I thought you had more sense. As for you, Mr. Potter, I thought Gryffindor meant more to you than this. All three of 
you will receive detentions — yes, you too, Mr. Longbottom, 
nothing gives you the right to walk around school at night, especially these days, it’s very dangerous — and fifty points will be 
taken from Gryffindor.” 
 CHAPTER FIFTEEN 
 244 
“Fifty?” Harry gasped — they would lose the lead, the lead he’d 
won in the last Quidditch match. 
“Fifty points each,” said Professor McGonagall, breathing heavily through her long, pointed nose. 
“Professor — please —” 
“You can’t —” 
“Don’t tell me what I can and can’t do, Potter. Now get back 
to bed, all of you. I’ve never been more ashamed of Gryffindor students.” 
A hundred and fifty points lost. That put Gryffindor in last 
place. In one night, they’d ruined any chance Gryffindor had had 
for the House Cup. Harry felt as though the bottom had dropped 
out of his stomach. How could they ever make up for this? 
Harry didn’t sleep all night. He could hear Neville sobbing into 
his pillow for what seemed like hours. Harry couldn’t think of anything to say to comfort him. He knew Neville, like himself, was 
dreading the dawn. What would happen when the rest of Gryffindor found out what they’d done? 
At first, Gryffindors passing the giant hourglasses that recorded 
the House points the next day thought there’d been a mistake. 
How could they suddenly have a hundred and fifty points fewer 
than yesterday? And then the story started to spread: Harry Potter, 
the famous Harry Potter, their hero of two Quidditch matches, had 
lost them all those points, him and a couple of other stupid first 
years. 
From being one of the most popular and admired people at the 
school, Harry was suddenly the most hated. Even Ravenclaws and 
Hufflepuffs turned on him, because everyone had been longing to 
see Slytherin lose the House Cup. Everywhere Harry went, people 
THE FORBIDDEN FOREST 
 245 
pointed and didn’t trouble to lower their voices as they insulted 
him. Slytherins, on the other hand, clapped as he walked past 
them, whistling and cheering, “Thanks Potter, we owe you one!” 
Only Ron stood by him. 
“They’ll all forget this in a few weeks. Fred and George have lost 
loads of points in all the time they’ve been here, and people still like 
them.” 
“They’ve never lost a hundred and fifty points in one go, 
though, have they?” said Harry miserably. 
“Well — no,” Ron admitted. 
It was a bit late to repair the damage, but Harry swore to himself 
not to meddle in things that weren’t his business from now on. 
He’d had it with sneaking around and spying. He felt so ashamed 
of himself that he went to Wood and offered to resign from the 
Quidditch team. 
“Resign?” Wood thundered. “What good’ll that do? How are we 
going to get any points back if we can’t win at Quidditch?” 
But even Quidditch had lost its fun. The rest of the team 
wouldn’t speak to Harry during practice, and if they had to speak 
about him, they called him “the Seeker.” 
Hermione and Neville were suffering, too. They didn’t have as 
bad a time as Harry, because they weren’t as well-known, but nobody would speak to them, either. Hermione had stopped drawing 
attention to herself in class, keeping her head down and working in 
silence. 
Harry was almost glad that the exams weren’t far away. All the 
studying he had to do kept his mind off his misery. He, Ron, and 
Hermione kept to themselves, working late into the night, trying 
to remember the ingredients in complicated potions, learn charms 
 CHAPTER FIFTEEN 
 246 
and spells by heart, memorize the dates of magical discoveries and 
goblin rebellions. . . . 
Then, about a week before the exams were due to start, Harry’s 
new resolution not to interfere in anything that didn’t concern him 
was put to an unexpected test. Walking back from the library on 
his own one afternoon, he heard somebody whimpering from a 
classroom up ahead. As he drew closer, he heard Quirrell’s voice. 
“No — no — not again, please —” 
It sounded as though someone was threatening him. Harry 
moved closer. 
“All right — all right —” he heard Quirrell sob. 
Next second, Quirrell came hurrying out of the classroom 
straightening his turban. He was pale and looked as though he was 
about to cry. He strode out of sight; Harry didn’t think Quirrell 
had even noticed him. He waited until Quirrell’s footsteps had disappeared, then peered into the classroom. It was empty, but a door 
stood ajar at the other end. Harry was halfway toward it before he 
remembered what he’d promised himself about not meddling. 
All the same, he’d have gambled twelve Sorcerer’s Stones that 
Snape had just left the room, and from what Harry had just heard, 
Snape would be walking with a new spring in his step — Quirrell 
seemed to have given in at last. 
Harry went back to the library, where Hermione was testing 
Ron on Astronomy. Harry told them what he’d heard. 
“Snape’s done it, then!” said Ron. “If Quirrell’s told him how to 
break his Anti-Dark Force spell —” 
“There’s still Fluffy, though,” said Hermione. 
“Maybe Snape’s found out how to get past him without asking 
Hagrid,” said Ron, looking up at the thousands of books sur-
THE FORBIDDEN FOREST 
 247 
rounding them. “I bet there’s a book somewhere in here telling you 
how to get past a giant three-headed dog. So what do we do, 
Harry?” 
The light of adventure was kindling again in Ron’s eyes, but 
Hermione answered before Harry could. 
“Go to Dumbledore. That’s what we should have done ages ago. 
If we try anything ourselves we’ll be thrown out for sure.” 
“But we’ve got no proof !” said Harry. “Quirrell’s too scared to 
back us up. Snape’s only got to say he doesn’t know how the troll 
got in at Halloween and that he was nowhere near the third 
floor — who do you think they’ll believe, him or us? It’s not exactly 
a secret we hate him, Dumbledore’ll think we made it up to get 
him sacked. Filch wouldn’t help us if his life depended on it, he’s 
too friendly with Snape, and the more students get thrown out, the 
better, he’ll think. And don’t forget, we’re not supposed to know 
about the Stone or Fluffy. That’ll take a lot of explaining.” 
Hermione looked convinced, but Ron didn’t. 
“If we just do a bit of poking around —” 
“No,” said Harry flatly, “we’ve done enough poking around.” 
He pulled a map of Jupiter toward him and started to learn the 
names of its moons. 
The following morning, notes were delivered to Harry, Hermione, 
and Neville at the breakfast table. They were all the same: 
Your detention will take place at eleven o’clock tonight. 
Meet Mr. Filch in the entrance hall. 
 CHAPTER FIFTEEN 
 248 
Harry had forgotten they still had detentions to do in the furor 
over the points they’d lost. He half expected Hermione to complain 
that this was a whole night of studying lost, but she didn’t say a 
word. Like Harry, she felt they deserved what they’d got. 
At eleven o’clock that night, they said good-bye to Ron in the 
common room and went down to the entrance hall with Neville. 
Filch was already there — and so was Malfoy. Harry had also forgotten that Malfoy had gotten a detention, too. 
“Follow me,” said Filch, lighting a lamp and leading them outside. 
“I bet you’ll think twice about breaking a school rule again, 
won’t you, eh?” he said, leering at them. “Oh yes . . . hard work 
and pain are the best teachers if you ask me. . . . It’s just a pity they 
let the old punishments die out . . . hang you by your wrists from 
the ceiling for a few days, I’ve got the chains still in my office, keep 
’em well oiled in case they’re ever needed. . . . Right, off we go, and 
don’t think of running off, now, it’ll be worse for you if you do.” 
They marched off across the dark grounds. Neville kept sniffing. 
Harry wondered what their punishment was going to be. It must 
be something really horrible, or Filch wouldn’t be sounding so delighted. 
The moon was bright, but clouds scudding across it kept throwing them into darkness. Ahead, Harry could see the lighted windows of Hagrid’s hut. Then they heard a distant shout. 
“Is that you, Filch? Hurry up, I want ter get started.” 
Harry’s heart rose; if they were going to be working with Hagrid 
it wouldn’t be so bad. His relief must have showed in his face, because Filch said, “I suppose you think you’ll be enjoying yourself 
THE FORBIDDEN FOREST 
 249 
with that oaf? Well, think again, boy — it’s into the forest you’re 
going and I’m much mistaken if you’ll all come out in one piece.” 
At this, Neville let out a little moan, and Malfoy stopped dead in 
his tracks. 
“The forest?” he repeated, and he didn’t sound quite as cool as 
usual. “We can’t go in there at night — there’s all sorts of things in 
there — werewolves, I heard.” 
Neville clutched the sleeve of Harry’s robe and made a choking 
noise. 
“That’s your problem, isn’t it?” said Filch, his voice cracking 
with glee. “Should’ve thought of them werewolves before you got 
in trouble, shouldn’t you?” 
Hagrid came striding toward them out of the dark, Fang at his 
heel. He was carrying his large crossbow, and a quiver of arrows 
hung over his shoulder. 
“Abou’ time,” he said. “I bin waitin’ fer half an hour already. All 
right, Harry, Hermione?” 
“I shouldn’t be too friendly to them, Hagrid,” said Filch coldly, 
“they’re here to be punished, after all.” 
“That’s why yer late, is it?” said Hagrid, frowning at Filch. “Bin 
lecturin’ them, eh? ’Snot your place ter do that. Yeh’ve done yer bit, 
I’ll take over from here.” 
“I’ll be back at dawn,” said Filch, “for what’s left of them,” he 
added nastily, and he turned and started back toward the castle, his 
lamp bobbing away in the darkness. 
Malfoy now turned to Hagrid. 
“I’m not going in that forest,” he said, and Harry was pleased to 
hear the note of panic in his voice. 
 CHAPTER FIFTEEN 
 250 
“Yeh are if yeh want ter stay at Hogwarts,” said Hagrid fiercely. 
“Yeh’ve done wrong an’ now yeh’ve got ter pay fer it.” 
“But this is servant stuff, it’s not for students to do. I thought 
we’d be copying lines or something, if my father knew I was doing 
this, he’d —” 
“— tell yer that’s how it is at Hogwarts,” Hagrid growled. 
“Copyin’ lines! What good’s that ter anyone? Yeh’ll do summat useful or yeh’ll get out. If yeh think yer father’d rather you were expelled, then get back off ter the castle an’ pack. Go on!” 
Malfoy didn’t move. He looked at Hagrid furiously, but then 
dropped his gaze. 
“Right then,” said Hagrid, “now, listen carefully, ’cause it’s dangerous what we’re gonna do tonight, an’ I don’ want no one takin’ 
risks. Follow me over here a moment.” 
He led them to the very edge of the forest. Holding his lamp up 
high, he pointed down a narrow, winding earth track that disappeared into the thick black trees. A light breeze lifted their hair as 
they looked into the forest. 
“Look there,” said Hagrid, “see that stuff shinin’ on the ground? 
Silvery stuff? That’s unicorn blood. There’s a unicorn in there bin 
hurt badly by summat. This is the second time in a week. I found 
one dead last Wednesday. We’re gonna try an’ find the poor thing. 
We might have ter put it out of its misery.” 
“And what if whatever hurt the unicorn finds us first?” said 
Malfoy, unable to keep the fear out of his voice. 
“There’s nothin’ that lives in the forest that’ll hurt yeh if yer with 
me or Fang,” said Hagrid. “An’ keep ter the path. Right, now, we’re 
gonna split inter two parties an’ follow the trail in diff ’rent direc- 
THE FORBIDDEN FOREST 
 251 
tions. There’s blood all over the place, it must’ve bin staggerin’ 
around since last night at least.” 
“I want Fang,” said Malfoy quickly, looking at Fang’s long teeth. 
“All right, but I warn yeh, he’s a coward,” said Hagrid. “So me, 
Harry, an’ Hermione’ll go one way an’ Draco, Neville, an’ Fang’ll 
go the other. Now, if any of us finds the unicorn, we’ll send up 
green sparks, right? Get yer wands out an’ practice now — that’s 
it — an’ if anyone gets in trouble, send up red sparks, an’ we’ll all 
come an’ find yeh — so, be careful — let’s go.” 
The forest was black and silent. A little way into it they reached 
a fork in the earth path, and Harry, Hermione, and Hagrid took 
the left path while Malfoy, Neville, and Fang took the right. 
They walked in silence, their eyes on the ground. Every now and 
then a ray of moonlight through the branches above lit a spot of 
silver-blue blood on the fallen leaves. 
Harry saw that Hagrid looked very worried. 
“Could a werewolf be killing the unicorns?” Harry asked. 
“Not fast enough,” said Hagrid. “It’s not easy ter catch a unicorn, they’re powerful magic creatures. I never knew one ter be 
hurt before.” 
They walked past a mossy tree stump. Harry could hear running 
water; there must be a stream somewhere close by. There were still 
spots of unicorn blood here and there along the winding path. 
“You all right, Hermione?” Hagrid whispered. “Don’ worry, it 
can’t’ve gone far if it’s this badly hurt, an’ then we’ll be able ter — 
GET BEHIND THAT TREE!” 
Hagrid seized Harry and Hermione and hoisted them off the 
path behind a towering oak. He pulled out an arrow and fitted it 
 CHAPTER FIFTEEN 
 252 
into his crossbow, raising it, ready to fire. The three of them listened. Something was slithering over dead leaves nearby: it 
sounded like a cloak trailing along the ground. Hagrid was squinting up the dark path, but after a few seconds, the sound faded 
away. 
“I knew it,” he murmured. “There’s summat in here that 
shouldn’ be.” 
“A werewolf?” Harry suggested. 
“That wasn’ no werewolf an’ it wasn’ no unicorn, neither,” said 
Hagrid grimly. “Right, follow me, but careful, now.” 
They walked more slowly, ears straining for the faintest sound. 
Suddenly, in a clearing ahead, something definitely moved. 
“Who’s there?” Hagrid called. “Show yerself — I’m armed!” 
And into the clearing came — was it a man, or a horse? To the 
waist, a man, with red hair and beard, but below that was a horse’s 
gleaming chestnut body with a long, reddish tail. Harry and 
Hermione’s jaws dropped. 
“Oh, it’s you, Ronan,” said Hagrid in relief. “How are yeh?” 
He walked forward and shook the centaur’s hand. 
“Good evening to you, Hagrid,” said Ronan. He had a deep, 
sorrowful voice. “Were you going to shoot me?” 
“Can’t be too careful, Ronan,” said Hagrid, patting his crossbow. 
“There’s summat bad loose in this forest. This is Harry Potter an’ 
Hermione Granger, by the way. Students up at the school. An’ this 
is Ronan, you two. He’s a centaur.” 
“We’d noticed,” said Hermione faintly. 
“Good evening,” said Ronan. “Students, are you? And do you 
learn much, up at the school?” 
THE FORBIDDEN FOREST 
 253 
“Erm —” 
“A bit,” said Hermione timidly. 
“A bit. Well, that’s something.” Ronan sighed. He flung back his 
head and stared at the sky. “Mars is bright tonight.” 
“Yeah,” said Hagrid, glancing up, too. “Listen, I’m glad we’ve 
run inter yeh, Ronan, ’cause there’s a unicorn bin hurt — you seen 
anythin’?” 
Ronan didn’t answer immediately. He stared unblinkingly upward, then sighed again. 
“Always the innocent are the first victims,” he said. “So it has 
been for ages past, so it is now.” 
“Yeah,” said Hagrid, “but have yeh seen anythin’, Ronan? Anythin’ unusual?” 
“Mars is bright tonight,” Ronan repeated, while Hagrid watched 
him impatiently. “Unusually bright.” 
“Yeah, but I was meanin’ anythin’ unusual a bit nearer home,” 
said Hagrid. “So yeh haven’t noticed anythin’ strange?” 
Yet again, Ronan took a while to answer. At last, he said, “The 
forest hides many secrets.” 
A movement in the trees behind Ronan made Hagrid raise his 
bow again, but it was only a second centaur, black-haired and 
-bodied and wilder-looking than Ronan. 
“Hullo, Bane,” said Hagrid. “All right?” 
“Good evening, Hagrid, I hope you are well?” 
“Well enough. Look, I’ve jus’ bin askin’ Ronan, you seen anythin’ odd in here lately? There’s a unicorn bin injured — would yeh 
know anythin’ about it?” 
Bane walked over to stand next to Ronan. He looked skyward. 
 CHAPTER FIFTEEN 
 254 
“Mars is bright tonight,” he said simply. 
“We’ve heard,” said Hagrid grumpily. “Well, if either of you do 
see anythin’, let me know, won’t yeh? We’ll be off, then.” 
Harry and Hermione followed him out of the clearing, staring 
over their shoulders at Ronan and Bane until the trees blocked 
their view. 
“Never,” said Hagrid irritably, “try an’ get a straight answer out 
of a centaur. Ruddy stargazers. Not interested in anythin’ closer’n 
the moon.” 
“Are there many of them in here?” asked Hermione. 
“Oh, a fair few. . . . Keep themselves to themselves mostly, but 
they’re good enough about turnin’ up if ever I want a word. They’re 
deep, mind, centaurs . . . they know things . . . jus’ don’ let on 
much.” 
“D’you think that was a centaur we heard earlier?” said Harry. 
“Did that sound like hooves to you? Nah, if yeh ask me, that was 
what’s bin killin’ the unicorns — never heard anythin’ like it before.” 
They walked on through the dense, dark trees. Harry kept looking nervously over his shoulder. He had the nasty feeling they were 
being watched. He was very glad they had Hagrid and his crossbow 
with them. They had just passed a bend in the path when Hermione grabbed Hagrid’s arm. 
“Hagrid! Look! Red sparks, the others are in trouble!” 
“You two wait here!” Hagrid shouted. “Stay on the path, I’ll 
come back for yeh!” 
They heard him crashing away through the undergrowth and 
stood looking at each other, very scared, until they couldn’t hear 
anything but the rustling of leaves around them. 
THE FORBIDDEN FOREST 
 255 
“You don’t think they’ve been hurt, do you?” whispered 
Hermione. 
“I don’t care if Malfoy has, but if something’s got Neville . . . it’s 
our fault he’s here in the first place.” 
The minutes dragged by. Their ears seemed sharper than usual. 
Harry’s seemed to be picking up every sigh of the wind, every 
cracking twig. What was going on? Where were the others? 
At last, a great crunching noise announced Hagrid’s return. Malfoy, Neville, and Fang were with him. Hagrid was fuming. Malfoy, 
it seemed, had sneaked up behind Neville and grabbed him as a 
joke. Neville had panicked and sent up the sparks. 
“We’ll be lucky ter catch anythin’ now, with the racket you two 
were makin’. Right, we’re changin’ groups — Neville, you stay 
with me an’ Hermione, Harry, you go with Fang an’ this idiot. I’m 
sorry,” Hagrid added in a whisper to Harry, “but he’ll have a harder 
time frightenin’ you, an’ we’ve gotta get this done.” 
So Harry set off into the heart of the forest with Malfoy and 
Fang. They walked for nearly half an hour, deeper and deeper into 
the forest, until the path became almost impossible to follow because the trees were so thick. Harry thought the blood seemed to 
be getting thicker. There were splashes on the roots of a tree, as 
though the poor creature had been thrashing around in pain close 
by. Harry could see a clearing ahead, through the tangled branches 
of an ancient oak. 
“Look —” he murmured, holding out his arm to stop Malfoy. 
Something bright white was gleaming on the ground. They 
inched closer. 
It was the unicorn all right, and it was dead. Harry had never 
seen anything so beautiful and sad. Its long, slender legs were stuck 
 CHAPTER FIFTEEN 
 256 
out at odd angles where it had fallen and its mane was spread 
pearly-white on the dark leaves. 
Harry had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound 
made him freeze where he stood. A bush on the edge of the clearing quivered. . . . Then, out of the shadows, a hooded figure came 
crawling across the ground like some stalking beast. Harry, Malfoy, 
and Fang stood transfixed. The cloaked figure reached the unicorn, 
lowered its head over the wound in the animals side, and began to 
drink its blood. 
“AAAAAAAAAAARGH!” 
Malfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted — so did Fang. The 
hooded figure raised its head and looked right at Harry — unicorn 
blood was dribbling down its front. It got to its feet and came 
swiftly toward Harry — he couldn’t move for fear. 
Then a pain like he’d never felt before pierced his head; it was as 
though his scar were on fire. Half blinded, he staggered backward. 
He heard hooves behind him, galloping, and something jumped 
clean over Harry, charging at the figure. 
The pain in Harry’s head was so bad he fell to his knees. It took 
a minute or two to pass. When he looked up, the figure had 
gone. A centaur was standing over him, not Ronan or Bane; this 
one looked younger; he had white-blond hair and a palomino 
body. 
“Are you all right?” said the centaur, pulling Harry to his feet. 
“Yes — thank you — what was that?” 
The centaur didn’t answer. He had astonishingly blue eyes, like 
pale sapphires. He looked carefully at Harry, his eyes lingering on 
the scar that stood out, livid, on Harry’s forehead. 
THE FORBIDDEN FOREST 
 257 
“You are the Potter boy,” he said. “You had better get back to 
Hagrid. The forest is not safe at this time — especially for you. 
Can you ride? It will be quicker this way. 
“My name is Firenze,” he added, as he lowered himself on to his 
front legs so that Harry could clamber onto his back. 
There was suddenly a sound of more galloping from the other 
side of the clearing. Ronan and Bane came bursting through the 
trees, their flanks heaving and sweaty. 
“Firenze!” Bane thundered. “What are you doing? You have a human on your back! Have you no shame? Are you a common mule?” 
“Do you realize who this is?” said Firenze. “This is the Potter 
boy. The quicker he leaves this forest, the better.” 
“What have you been telling him?” growled Bane. “Remember, 
Firenze, we are sworn not to set ourselves against the heavens. Have 
we not read what is to come in the movements of the planets?” 
Ronan pawed the ground nervously. “I’m sure Firenze thought he 
was acting for the best,” he said in his gloomy voice. 
Bane kicked his back legs in anger. 
“For the best! What is that to do with us? Centaurs are concerned with what has been foretold! It is not our business to run 
around like donkeys after stray humans in our forest!” 
Firenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger, so that 
Harry had to grab his shoulders to stay on. 
“Do you not see that unicorn?” Firenze bellowed at Bane. “Do 
you not understand why it was killed? Or have the planets not let 
you in on that secret? I set myself against what is lurking in this forest, Bane, yes, with humans alongside me if I must.” 
And Firenze whisked around; with Harry clutching on as best he 
 CHAPTER FIFTEEN 
 258 
could, they plunged off into the trees, leaving Ronan and Bane behind them. 
Harry didn’t have a clue what was going on. 
“Why’s Bane so angry?” he asked. “What was that thing you 
saved me from, anyway?” 
Firenze slowed to a walk, warned Harry to keep his head bowed 
in case of low-hanging branches, but did not answer Harry’s question. They made their way through the trees in silence for so long 
that Harry thought Firenze didn’t want to talk to him anymore. 
They were passing through a particularly dense patch of trees, however, when Firenze suddenly stopped. 
“Harry Potter, do you know what unicorn blood is used for?” 
“No,” said Harry, startled by the odd question. “We’ve only used 
the horn and tail hair in Potions.” 
“That is because it is a monstrous thing, to slay a unicorn,” said 
Firenze. “Only one who has nothing to lose, and everything to 
gain, would commit such a crime. The blood of a unicorn will keep 
you alive, even if you are an inch from death, but at a terrible price. 
You have slain something pure and defenseless to save yourself, and 
you will have but a half-life, a cursed life, from the moment the 
blood touches your lips.” 
Harry stared at the back of Firenze’s head, which was dappled 
silver in the moonlight. 
“But who’d be that desperate?” he wondered aloud. “If you’re going to be cursed forever, death’s better, isn’t it?” 
“It is,” Firenze agreed, “unless all you need is to stay alive long 
enough to drink something else — something that will bring you 
back to full strength and power — something that will mean you 
THE FORBIDDEN FOREST 
 259 
can never die. Mr. Potter, do you know what is hidden in the 
school at this very moment?” 
“The Sorcerer’s Stone! Of course — the Elixir of Life! But I don’t 
understand who —” 
“Can you think of nobody who has waited many years to return 
to power, who has clung to life, awaiting their chance?” 
It was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around 
Harry’s heart. Over the rustling of the trees, he seemed to hear once 
more what Hagrid had told him on the night they had met: “Some 
say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough 
human left in him to die.” 
“Do you mean,” Harry croaked, “that was Vol —” 
“Harry! Harry, are you all right?” 
Hermione was running toward them down the path, Hagrid 
puffing along behind her. 
“I’m fine,” said Harry, hardly knowing what he was saying. “The 
unicorns dead, Hagrid, it’s in that clearing back there.” 
“This is where I leave you,” Firenze murmured as Hagrid hurried off to examine the unicorn. “You are safe now.” 
Harry slid off his back. 
“Good luck, Harry Potter,” said Firenze. “The planets have been 
read wrongly before now, even by centaurs. I hope this is one of 
those times.” 
He turned and cantered back into the depths of the forest, leaving Harry shivering behind him. 
Ron had fallen asleep in the dark common room, waiting for them 
to return. He shouted something about Quidditch fouls when 
 CHAPTER FIFTEEN 
 260 
Harry roughly shook him awake. In a matter of seconds, though, 
he was wide-eyed as Harry began to tell him and Hermione what 
had happened in the forest. 
Harry couldn’t sit down. He paced up and down in front of the 
fire. He was still shaking. 
“Snape wants the Stone for Voldemort . . . and Voldemort’s waiting in the forest . . . and all this time we thought Snape just wanted 
to get rich. . . .” 
“Stop saying the name!” said Ron in a terrified whisper, as if he 
thought Voldemort could hear them. 
Harry wasn’t listening. 
“Firenze saved me, but he shouldn’t have done so. . . . Bane was 
furious . . . he was talking about interfering with what the planets 
say is going to happen. . . . They must show that Voldemort’s coming back. . . . Bane thinks Firenze should have let Voldemort kill 
me. . . . I suppose that’s written in the stars as well.” 
“Will you stop saying the name!” Ron hissed. 
“So all I’ve got to wait for now is Snape to steal the Stone,” 
Harry went on feverishly, “then Voldemort will be able to come 
and finish me off. . . . Well, I suppose Bane’ll be happy.” 
Hermione looked very frightened, but she had a word of comfort. 
“Harry, everyone says Dumbledore’s the only one You-KnowWho was ever afraid of. With Dumbledore around, You-KnowWho won’t touch you. Anyway, who says the centaurs are right? It 
sounds like fortune-telling to me, and Professor McGonagall says 
that’s a very imprecise branch of magic.” 
The sky had turned light before they stopped talking. They went 
THE FORBIDDEN FOREST 
 261 
to bed exhausted, their throats sore. But the night’s surprises 
weren’t over. 
When Harry pulled back his sheets, he found his Invisibility 
Cloak folded neatly underneath them. There was a note pinned 
to it: 
Just in case.

n years to come, Harry would never quite remember how he 
had managed to get through his exams when he half expected 
Voldemort to come bursting through the door at any moment. Yet 
the days crept by, and there could be no doubt that Fluffy was still 
alive and well behind the locked door. 
It was sweltering hot, especially in the large classroom where 
they did their written papers. They had been given special, new 
quills for the exams, which had been bewitched with an AntiCheating spell. 
They had practical exams as well. Professor Flitwick called them 
one by one into his class to see if they could make a pineapple tapdance across a desk. Professor McGonagall watched them turn a 
mouse into a snuffbox — points were given for how pretty the 
snuffbox was, but taken away if it had whiskers. Snape made them 
all nervous, breathing down their necks while they tried to remember how to make a Forgetfulness potion.

Harry did the best he could, trying to ignore the stabbing pains 
in his forehead, which had been bothering him ever since his trip 
into the forest. Neville thought Harry had a bad case of exam 
nerves because Harry couldn’t sleep, but the truth was that Harry 
kept being woken by his old nightmare, except that it was now 
worse than ever because there was a hooded figure dripping blood 
in it. 
Maybe it was because they hadn’t seen what Harry had seen in 
the forest, or because they didn’t have scars burning on their foreheads, but Ron and Hermione didn’t seem as worried about the 
Stone as Harry. The idea of Voldemort certainly scared them, but 
he didn’t keep visiting them in dreams, and they were so busy with 
their studying they didn’t have much time to fret about what Snape 
or anyone else might be up to. 
Their very last exam was History of Magic. One hour of answering questions about batty old wizards who’d invented selfstirring cauldrons and they’d be free, free for a whole wonderful 
week until their exam results came out. When the ghost of Professor Binns told them to put down their quills and roll up their 
parchment, Harry couldn’t help cheering with the rest. 
“That was far easier than I thought it would be,” said Hermione 
as they joined the crowds flocking out onto the sunny grounds. “I 
needn’t have learned about the 1637 Werewolf Code of Conduct or 
the uprising of Elfric the Eager.” 
Hermione always liked to go through their exam papers afterward, but Ron said this made him feel ill, so they wandered down 
to the lake and flopped under a tree. The Weasley twins and Lee 
Jordan were tickling the tentacles of a giant squid, which was basking in the warm shallows. 
 CHAPTER SIXTEEN

“No more studying,” Ron sighed happily, stretching out on the 
grass. “You could look more cheerful, Harry, we’ve got a week before we find out how badly we’ve done, there’s no need to worry 
yet.” 
Harry was rubbing his forehead. 
“I wish I knew what this means!” he burst out angrily. “My scar 
keeps hurting — it’s happened before, but never as often as this.” 
“Go to Madam Pomfrey,” Hermione suggested. 
“I’m not ill,” said Harry. “I think it’s a warning . . . it means 
danger’s coming. . . .” 
Ron couldn’t get worked up, it was too hot. 
“Harry, relax, Hermione’s right, the Stone’s safe as long as Dumbledore’s around. Anyway, we’ve never had any proof Snape found 
out how to get past Fluffy. He nearly had his leg ripped off once, 
he’s not going to try it again in a hurry. And Neville will play Quidditch for England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down.” 
Harry nodded, but he couldn’t shake off a lurking feeling that 
there was something he’d forgotten to do, something important. 
When he tried to explain this, Hermione said, “That’s just the exams. I woke up last night and was halfway through my Transfiguration notes before I remembered we’d done that one.” 
Harry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didn’t have anything 
to do with work, though. He watched an owl flutter toward the 
school across the bright blue sky, a note clamped in its mouth. Hagrid was the only one who ever sent him letters. Hagrid would 
never betray Dumbledore. Hagrid would never tell anyone how to 
get past Fluffy . . . never . . . but — 
Harry suddenly jumped to his feet.

 265 
“Where’re you going?” said Ron sleepily. 
“I’ve just thought of something,” said Harry. He had turned 
white. “We’ve got to go and see Hagrid, now.” 
“Why?” panted Hermione, hurrying to keep up. 
“Don’t you think it’s a bit odd,” said Harry, scrambling up the 
grassy slope, “that what Hagrid wants more than anything else is a 
dragon, and a stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in 
his pocket? How many people wander around with dragon eggs if 
it’s against wizard law? Lucky they found Hagrid, don’t you think? 
Why didn’t I see it before?” 
“What are you talking about?” said Ron, but Harry, sprinting 
across the grounds toward the forest, didn’t answer. 
Hagrid was sitting in an armchair outside his house; his trousers 
and sleeves were rolled up, and he was shelling peas into a large 
bowl. 
“Hullo,” he said, smiling. “Finished yer exams? Got time fer a 
drink?” 
“Yes, please,” said Ron, but Harry cut him off. 
“No, we’re in a hurry. Hagrid, I’ve got to ask you something. You 
know that night you won Norbert? What did the stranger you were 
playing cards with look like?” 
“Dunno,” said Hagrid casually, “he wouldn’ take his cloak off.” 
He saw the three of them look stunned and raised his eyebrows. 
“It’s not that unusual, yeh get a lot o’ funny folk in the Hog’s 
Head — that’s one o’ the pubs down in the village. Mighta bin a 
dragon dealer, mightn’ he? I never saw his face, he kept his hood up.” 
Harry sank down next to the bowl of peas. 
 CHAPTER SIXTEEN 
 266 
“What did you talk to him about, Hagrid? Did you mention 
Hogwarts at all?” 
“Mighta come up,” said Hagrid, frowning as he tried to remember. “Yeah . . . he asked what I did, an’ I told him I was gamekeeper 
here. . . . He asked a bit about the sorta creatures I look after . . . 
so I told him . . . an’ I said what I’d always really wanted was a 
dragon . . . an’ then . . . I can’ remember too well, ’cause he kept 
buyin’ me drinks. . . . Let’s see . . . yeah, then he said he had the 
dragon egg an’ we could play cards fer it if I wanted . . . but he had 
ter be sure I could handle it, he didn’ want it ter go ter any old 
home. . . . So I told him, after Fluffy, a dragon would be easy. . . .” 
“And did he — did he seem interested in Fluffy?” Harry asked, 
trying to keep his voice calm. 
“Well — yeah — how many three-headed dogs d’yeh meet, 
even around Hogwarts? So I told him, Fluffy’s a piece o’ cake if yeh 
know how to calm him down, jus’ play him a bit o’ music an’ he’ll 
go straight off ter sleep —” 
Hagrid suddenly looked horrified. 
“I shouldn’ta told yeh that!” he blurted out. “Forget I said it! 
Hey — where’re yeh goin’?” 
Harry, Ron, and Hermione didn’t speak to each other at all until they came to a halt in the entrance hall, which seemed very cold 
and gloomy after the grounds. 
“We’ve got to go to Dumbledore,” said Harry. “Hagrid told that 
stranger how to get past Fluffy, and it was either Snape or Voldemort under that cloak — it must’ve been easy, once he’d got Hagrid drunk. I just hope Dumbledore believes us. Firenze might 
back us up if Bane doesn’t stop him. Where’s Dumbledore’s office?” 
THROUGH THE TRAPDOOR 
 267 
They looked around, as if hoping to see a sign pointing them in 
the right direction. They had never been told where Dumbledore 
lived, nor did they know anyone who had been sent to see him. 
“We’ll just have to —” Harry began, but a voice suddenly rang 
across the hall. 
“What are you three doing inside?” 
It was Professor McGonagall, carrying a large pile of books. 
“We want to see Professor Dumbledore,” said Hermione, rather 
bravely, Harry and Ron thought. 
“See Professor Dumbledore?” Professor McGonagall repeated, as 
though this was a very fishy thing to want to do. “Why?” 
Harry swallowed — now what? 
“It’s sort of secret,” he said, but he wished at once he hadn’t, because Professor McGonagall’s nostrils flared. 
“Professor Dumbledore left ten minutes ago,” she said coldly. 
“He received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and flew 
off for London at once.” 
“He’s gone?” said Harry frantically. “Now?” 
“Professor Dumbledore is a very great wizard, Potter, he has 
many demands on his time —” 
“But this is important.” 
“Something you have to say is more important than the Ministry of Magic, Potter?” 
“Look,” said Harry, throwing caution to the winds, “Professor — it’s about the Sorcerer’s Stone —” 
Whatever Professor McGonagall had expected, it wasn’t that. 
The books she was carrying tumbled out of her arms, but she didn’t 
pick them up. 
 CHAPTER SIXTEEN 
 268 
“How do you know — ?” she spluttered. 
“Professor, I think — I know — that Sn— that someone’s going 
to try and steal the Stone. I’ve got to talk to Professor Dumbledore.” 
She eyed him with a mixture of shock and suspicion. 
“Professor Dumbledore will be back tomorrow,” she said finally. 
“I don’t know how you found out about the Stone, but rest assured, 
no one can possibly steal it, it’s too well protected.” 
“But Professor —” 
“Potter, I know what I’m talking about,” she said shortly. She 
bent down and gathered up the fallen books. “I suggest you all go 
back outside and enjoy the sunshine.” 
But they didn’t. 
“It’s tonight,” said Harry, once he was sure Professor McGonagall was out of earshot. “Snape’s going through the trapdoor 
tonight. He’s found out everything he needs, and now he’s got 
Dumbledore out of the way. He sent that note, I bet the Ministry 
of Magic will get a real shock when Dumbledore turns up.” 
“But what can we —” 
Hermione gasped. Harry and Ron wheeled round. 
Snape was standing there. 
“Good afternoon,” he said smoothly. 
They stared at him. 
“You shouldn’t be inside on a day like this,” he said, with an odd, 
twisted smile. 
“We were —” Harry began, without any idea what he was going 
to say. 
“You want to be more careful,” said Snape. “Hanging around 
THROUGH THE TRAPDOOR 
 269 
like this, people will think you’re up to something. And Gryffindor 
really can’t afford to lose any more points, can it?” 
Harry flushed. They turned to go outside, but Snape called them 
back. 
“Be warned, Potter — any more nighttime wanderings and I will 
personally make sure you are expelled. Good day to you.” 
He strode off in the direction of the staffroom. 
Out on the stone steps, Harry turned to the others. 
“Right, here’s what we’ve got to do,” he whispered urgently. “One 
of us has got to keep an eye on Snape — wait outside the staffroom 
and follow him if he leaves it. Hermione, you’d better do that.” 
“Why me?” 
“It’s obvious,” said Ron. “You can pretend to be waiting for 
Professor Flitwick, you know.” He put on a high voice, “ ‘Oh Professor Flitwick, I’m so worried, I think I got question fourteen b 
wrong. . . .’ ” 
“Oh, shut up,” said Hermione, but she agreed to go and watch 
out for Snape. 
“And we’d better stay outside the third-floor corridor,” Harry 
told Ron. “Come on.” 
But that part of the plan didn’t work. No sooner had they 
reached the door separating Fluffy from the rest of the school than 
Professor McGonagall turned up again and this time, she lost her 
temper. 
“I suppose you think you’re harder to get past than a pack of enchantments!” she stormed. “Enough of this nonsense! If I hear 
you’ve come anywhere near here again, I’ll take another fifty points 
from Gryffindor! Yes, Weasley, from my own House!” 
 CHAPTER SIXTEEN 
 270 
Harry and Ron went back to the common room. Harry had just 
said, “At least Hermione’s on Snape’s tail,” when the portrait of the 
Fat Lady swung open and Hermione came in. 
“I’m sorry, Harry!” she wailed. “Snape came out and asked me 
what I was doing, so I said I was waiting for Flitwick, and Snape 
went to get him, and I’ve only just got away, I don’t know where 
Snape went.” 
“Well, that’s it then, isn’t it?” Harry said. 
The other two stared at him. He was pale and his eyes were glittering. 
“I’m going out of here tonight and I’m going to try and get to 
the Stone first.” 
“You’re mad!” said Ron. 
“You can’t!” said Hermione. “After what McGonagall and Snape 
have said? You’ll be expelled!” 
“SO WHAT?” Harry shouted. “Don’t you understand? If Snape 
gets hold of the Stone, Voldemort’s coming back! Haven’t you 
heard what it was like when he was trying to take over? There won’t 
be any Hogwarts to get expelled from! He’ll flatten it, or turn it 
into a school for the Dark Arts! Losing points doesn’t matter anymore, can’t you see? D’you think he’ll leave you and your families 
alone if Gryffindor wins the House Cup? If I get caught before I 
can get to the Stone, well, I’ll have to go back to the Dursleys and 
wait for Voldemort to find me there, it’s only dying a bit later than 
I would have, because I’m never going over to the Dark Side! I’m 
going through that trapdoor tonight and nothing you two say is 
going to stop me! Voldemort killed my parents, remember?” 
He glared at them. 
THROUGH THE TRAPDOOR 
 271 
“You’re right, Harry,” said Hermione in a small voice. 
“I’ll use the Invisibility Cloak,” said Harry. “It’s just lucky I got 
it back.” 
“But will it cover all three of us?” said Ron. 
“All — all three of us?” 
“Oh, come off it, you don’t think we’d let you go alone?” 
“Of course not,” said Hermione briskly. “How do you think 
you’d get to the Stone without us? I’d better go and look through 
my books, there might be something useful. . . .” 
“But if we get caught, you two will be expelled, too.” 
“Not if I can help it,” said Hermione grimly. “Flitwick told me 
in secret that I got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam. 
They’re not throwing me out after that.” 
After dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in the common 
room. Nobody bothered them; none of the Gryffindors had anything to say to Harry any more, after all. This was the first night he 
hadn’t been upset by it. Hermione was skimming through all her 
notes, hoping to come across one of the enchantments they were 
about to try to break. Harry and Ron didn’t talk much. Both of 
them were thinking about what they were about to do. 
Slowly, the room emptied as people drifted off to bed. 
“Better get the cloak,” Ron muttered, as Lee Jordan finally left, 
stretching and yawning. Harry ran upstairs to their dark dormitory. He pulled out the cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute Hagrid had given him for Christmas. He pocketed it to use on 
Fluffy — he didn’t feel much like singing. 
He ran back down to the common room. 
 CHAPTER SIXTEEN 
 272 
“We’d better put the cloak on here, and make sure it covers all 
three of us — if Filch spots one of our feet wandering along on its 
own —” 
“What are you doing?” said a voice from the corner of the room. 
Neville appeared from behind an armchair, clutching Trevor the 
toad, who looked as though he’d been making another bid for freedom. 
“Nothing, Neville, nothing,” said Harry, hurriedly putting the 
cloak behind his back. 
Neville stared at their guilty faces. 
“You’re going out again,” he said. 
“No, no, no,” said Hermione. “No, we’re not. Why don’t you go 
to bed, Neville?” 
Harry looked at the grandfather clock by the door. They 
couldn’t afford to waste any more time, Snape might even now be 
playing Fluffy to sleep. 
“You can’t go out,” said Neville, “you’ll be caught again. 
Gryffindor will be in even more trouble.” 
“You don’t understand,” said Harry, “this is important.” 
But Neville was clearly steeling himself to do something desperate. 
“I won’t let you do it,” he said, hurrying to stand in front of the 
portrait hole. “I’ll — I’ll fight you!” 
“Neville,” Ron exploded, “get away from that hole and don’t be 
an idiot —” 
“Don’t you call me an idiot!” said Neville. “I don’t think you 
should be breaking any more rules! And you were the one who told 
me to stand up to people!” 
THROUGH THE TRAPDOOR 
 273 
“Yes, but not to us,” said Ron in exasperation. “Neville, you 
don’t know what you’re doing.” 
He took a step forward and Neville dropped Trevor the toad, 
who leapt out of sight. 
“Go on then, try and hit me!” said Neville, raising his fists. “I’m 
ready!” 
Harry turned to Hermione. 
“Do something,” he said desperately. 
Hermione stepped forward. 
“Neville,” she said, “I’m really, really sorry about this.” 
She raised her wand. 
“Petrificus Totalus!” she cried, pointing it at Neville. 
Neville’s arms snapped to his sides. His legs sprang together. His 
whole body rigid, he swayed where he stood and then fell flat on 
his face, stiff as a board. 
Hermione ran to turn him over. Neville’s jaws were jammed together so he couldn’t speak. Only his eyes were moving, looking at 
them in horror. 
“What’ve you done to him?” Harry whispered. 
“It’s the full Body-Bind,” said Hermione miserably. “Oh, 
Neville, I’m so sorry.” 
“We had to, Neville, no time to explain,” said Harry. 
“You’ll understand later, Neville,” said Ron as they stepped over 
him and pulled on the Invisibility Cloak. 
But leaving Neville lying motionless on the floor didn’t feel like 
a very good omen. In their nervous state, every statue’s shadow 
looked like Filch, every distant breath of wind sounded like Peeves 
swooping down on them. 
 CHAPTER SIXTEEN 
 274 
At the foot of the first set of stairs, they spotted Mrs. Norris 
skulking near the top. 
“Oh, let’s kick her, just this once,” Ron whispered in Harry’s ear, 
but Harry shook his head. As they climbed carefully around her, 
Mrs. Norris turned her lamplike eyes on them, but didn’t do anything. 
They didn’t meet anyone else until they reached the staircase up 
to the third floor. Peeves was bobbing halfway up, loosening the 
carpet so that people would trip. 
“Who’s there?” he said suddenly as they climbed toward him. He 
narrowed his wicked black eyes. “Know you’re there, even if I can’t 
see you. Are you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie?” 
He rose up in the air and floated there, squinting at them. 
“Should call Filch, I should, if something’s a-creeping around 
unseen.” 
Harry had a sudden idea. 
“Peeves,” he said, in a hoarse whisper, “the Bloody Baron has his 
own reasons for being invisible.” 
Peeves almost fell out of the air in shock. He caught himself in 
time and hovered about a foot off the stairs. 
“So sorry, your bloodiness, Mr. Baron, sir,” he said greasily. “My 
mistake, my mistake — I didn’t see you — of course I didn’t, 
you’re invisible — forgive old Peevsie his little joke, sir.” 
“I have business here, Peeves,” croaked Harry. “Stay away from 
this place tonight.” 
“I will, sir, I most certainly will,” said Peeves, rising up in the air 
again. “Hope your business goes well, Baron, I’ll not bother you.” 
And he scooted off. 
THROUGH THE TRAPDOOR 
 275 
“Brilliant, Harry!” whispered Ron. 
A few seconds later, they were there, outside the third-floor corridor — and the door was already ajar. 
“Well, there you are,” Harry said quietly, “Snape’s already got 
past Fluffy.” 
Seeing the open door somehow seemed to impress upon all three 
of them what was facing them. Underneath the cloak, Harry 
turned to the other two. 
“If you want to go back, I won’t blame you,” he said. “You can 
take the cloak, I won’t need it now.” 
“Don’t be stupid,” said Ron. 
“We’re coming,” said Hermione. 
Harry pushed the door open. 
As the door creaked, low, rumbling growls met their ears. All 
three of the dog’s noses sniffed madly in their direction, even 
though it couldn’t see them. 
“What’s that at its feet?” Hermione whispered. 
“Looks like a harp,” said Ron. “Snape must have left it there.” 
“It must wake up the moment you stop playing,” said Harry. 
“Well, here goes . . .” 
He put Hagrid’s flute to his lips and blew. It wasn’t really a tune, 
but from the first note the beast’s eyes began to droop. Harry 
hardly drew breath. Slowly, the dog’s growls ceased — it tottered 
on its paws and fell to its knees, then it slumped to the ground, fast 
asleep. 
“Keep playing,” Ron warned Harry as they slipped out of the 
cloak and crept toward the trapdoor. They could feel the dog’s hot, 
smelly breath as they approached the giant heads. 
 CHAPTER SIXTEEN 
 276 
“I think we’ll be able to pull the door open,” said Ron, peering 
over the dog’s back. “Want to go first, Hermione?” 
“No, I don’t!” 
“All right.” Ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully over the 
dog’s legs. He bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor, which 
swung up and open. 
“What can you see?” Hermione said anxiously. 
“Nothing — just black — there’s no way of climbing down, 
we’ll just have to drop.” 
Harry, who was still playing the flute, waved at Ron to get his attention and pointed at himself. 
“You want to go first? Are you sure?” said Ron. “I don’t know 
how deep this thing goes. Give the flute to Hermione so she can 
keep him asleep.” 
Harry handed the flute over. In the few seconds’ silence, the dog 
growled and twitched, but the moment Hermione began to play, it 
fell back into its deep sleep. 
Harry climbed over it and looked down through the trapdoor. 
There was no sign of the bottom. 
He lowered himself through the hole until he was hanging on by 
his fingertips. Then he looked up at Ron and said, “If anything 
happens to me, don’t follow. Go straight to the owlery and send 
Hedwig to Dumbledore, right?” 
“Right,” said Ron. 
“See you in a minute, I hope. . . .” 
And Harry let go. Cold, damp air rushed past him as he fell 
down, down, down and — 
FLUMP. With a funny, muffled sort of thump he landed on 
THROUGH THE TRAPDOOR 
 277 
something soft. He sat up and felt around, his eyes not used to the 
gloom. It felt as though he was sitting on some sort of plant. 
“It’s okay!” he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp, 
which was the open trapdoor, “it’s a soft landing, you can jump!” 
Ron followed right away. He landed, sprawled next to Harry. 
“What’s this stuff?” were his first words. 
“Dunno, some sort of plant thing. I suppose it’s here to break 
the fall. Come on, Hermione!” 
The distant music stopped. There was a loud bark from the dog, 
but Hermione had already jumped. She landed on Harry’s other 
side. 
“We must be miles under the school,” she said. 
“Lucky this plant thing’s here, really,” said Ron. 
“Lucky!” shrieked Hermione. “Look at you both!” 
She leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall. She had to 
struggle because the moment she had landed, the plant had started 
to twist snakelike tendrils around her ankles. As for Harry and 
Ron, their legs had already been bound tightly in long creepers 
without their noticing. 
Hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a 
firm grip on her. Now she watched in horror as the two boys fought 
to pull the plant off them, but the more they strained against it, the 
tighter and faster the plant wound around them. 
“Stop moving!” Hermione ordered them. “I know what this 
is — it’s Devil’s Snare!” 
“Oh, I’m so glad we know what it’s called, that’s a great help,” 
snarled Ron, leaning back, trying to stop the plant from curling 
around his neck. 
 CHAPTER SIXTEEN 
 278 
“Shut up, I’m trying to remember how to kill it!” said Hermione. 
“Well, hurry up, I can’t breathe!” Harry gasped, wrestling with it 
as it curled around his chest. 
“Devil’s Snare, Devil’s Snare . . . what did Professor Sprout 
say? — it likes the dark and the damp —” 
“So light a fire!” Harry choked. 
“Yes — of course — but there’s no wood!” Hermione cried, 
wringing her hands. 
“HAVE YOU GONE MAD?” Ron bellowed. “ARE YOU A 
WITCH OR NOT?” 
“Oh, right!” said Hermione, and she whipped out her wand, 
waved it, muttered something, and sent a jet of the same bluebell 
flames she had used on Snape at the plant. In a matter of seconds, 
the two boys felt it loosening its grip as it cringed away from the 
light and warmth. Wriggling and flailing, it unraveled itself from 
their bodies, and they were able to pull free. 
“Lucky you pay attention in Herbology, Hermione,” said Harry 
as he joined her by the wall, wiping sweat off his face. 
“Yeah,” said Ron, “and lucky Harry doesn’t lose his head in a crisis — ‘there’s no wood,’ honestly.” 
“This way,” said Harry, pointing down a stone passageway, which 
was the only way forward. 
All they could hear apart from their footsteps was the gentle drip 
of water trickling down the walls. The passageway sloped downward, and Harry was reminded of Gringotts. With an unpleasant 
jolt of the heart, he remembered the dragons said to be guarding 
vaults in the wizards’ bank. If they met a dragon, a fully-grown 
dragon — Norbert had been bad enough . . . 
THROUGH THE TRAPDOOR 
 279 
“Can you hear something?” Ron whispered. 
Harry listened. A soft rustling and clinking seemed to be coming from up ahead. 
“Do you think it’s a ghost?” 
“I don’t know . . . sounds like wings to me.” 
“There’s light ahead — I can see something moving.” 
They reached the end of the passageway and saw before them a 
brilliantly lit chamber, its ceiling arching high above them. It was 
full of small, jewel-bright birds, fluttering and tumbling all around 
the room. On the opposite side of the chamber was a heavy 
wooden door. 
“Do you think they’ll attack us if we cross the room?” said Ron. 
“Probably,” said Harry. “They don’t look very vicious, but I suppose if they all swooped down at once . . . well, there’s no other 
choice . . . I’ll run.” 
He took a deep breath, covered his face with his arms, and 
sprinted across the room. He expected to feel sharp beaks and claws 
tearing at him any second, but nothing happened. He reached the 
door untouched. He pulled the handle, but it was locked. 
The other two followed him. They tugged and heaved at the 
door, but it wouldn’t budge, not even when Hermione tried her 
Alohomora Charm. 
“Now what?” said Ron. 
“These birds . . . they can’t be here just for decoration,” said 
Hermione. 
They watched the birds soaring overhead, glittering — glittering? 
“They’re not birds!” Harry said suddenly. “They’re keys! Winged 
keys — look carefully. So that must mean . . .” he looked around 
 CHAPTER SIXTEEN 
 280 
the chamber while the other two squinted up at the flock of keys. 
“. . . yes — look! Broomsticks! We’ve got to catch the key to the 
door!” 
“But there are hundreds of them!” 
Ron examined the lock on the door. 
“We’re looking for a big, old-fashioned one — probably silver, 
like the handle.” 
They each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the air, soaring into the midst of the cloud of keys. They grabbed and snatched, 
but the bewitched keys darted and dived so quickly it was almost 
impossible to catch one. 
Not for nothing, though, was Harry the youngest Seeker in a 
century. He had a knack for spotting things other people didn’t. After a minute’s weaving about through the whirl of rainbow feathers, 
he noticed a large silver key that had a bent wing, as if it had already been caught and stuffed roughly into the keyhole. 
“That one!” he called to the others. “That big one — there — 
no, there — with bright blue wings — the feathers are all crumpled on one side.” 
Ron went speeding in the direction that Harry was pointing, 
crashed into the ceiling, and nearly fell off his broom. 
“We’ve got to close in on it!” Harry called, not taking his eyes off 
the key with the damaged wing. “Ron, you come at it from 
above — Hermione, stay below and stop it from going down — 
and I’ll try and catch it. Right, NOW!” 
Ron dived, Hermione rocketed upward, the key dodged them 
both, and Harry streaked after it; it sped toward the wall, Harry 
leaned forward and with a nasty, crunching noise, pinned it against

the stone with one hand. Ron and Hermione’s cheers echoed 
around the high chamber. 
They landed quickly, and Harry ran to the door, the key struggling in his hand. He rammed it into the lock and turned — it 
worked. The moment the lock had clicked open, the key took 
flight again, looking very battered now that it had been caught 
twice. 
“Ready?” Harry asked the other two, his hand on the door handle. They nodded. He pulled the door open. 
The next chamber was so dark they couldn’t see anything at all. 
But as they stepped into it, light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing sight. 
They were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard, behind 
the black chessmen, which were all taller than they were and carved 
from what looked like black stone. Facing them, way across the 
chamber, were the white pieces. Harry, Ron and Hermione shivered slightly — the towering white chessmen had no faces. 
“Now what do we do?” Harry whispered. 
“It’s obvious, isn’t it?” said Ron. “We’ve got to play our way 
across the room.” 
Behind the white pieces they could see another door. 
“How?” said Hermione nervously. 
“I think,” said Ron, “we’re going to have to be chessmen.” 
He walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch 
the knights horse. At once, the stone sprang to life. The horse pawed 
the ground and the knight turned his helmeted head to look down 
at Ron. 
“Do we — er — have to join you to get across?” 
 CHAPTER SIXTEEN 
 282 
The black knight nodded. Ron turned to the other two. 
“This needs thinking about. . . .” he said. “I suppose we’ve got 
to take the place of three of the black pieces. . . .” 
Harry and Hermione stayed quiet, watching Ron think. Finally 
he said, “Now, don’t be offended or anything, but neither of you are 
that good at chess —” 
“We’re not offended,” said Harry quickly. “Just tell us what 
to do.” 
“Well, Harry, you take the place of that bishop, and Hermione, 
you go there instead of that castle.” 
“What about you?” 
“I’m going to be a knight,” said Ron. 
The chessmen seemed to have been listening, because at these 
words a knight, a bishop, and a castle turned their backs on the 
white pieces and walked off the board, leaving three empty squares 
that Harry, Ron, and Hermione took. 
“White always plays first in chess,” said Ron, peering across the 
board. “Yes . . . look . . .” 
A white pawn had moved forward two squares. 
Ron started to direct the black pieces. They moved silently 
wherever he sent them. Harry’s knees were trembling. What if they 
lost? 
“Harry — move diagonally four squares to the right.” 
Their first real shock came when their other knight was taken. 
The white queen smashed him to the floor and dragged him off the 
board, where he lay quite still, facedown. 
“Had to let that happen,” said Ron, looking shaken. “Leaves you 
free to take that bishop, Hermione, go on.” 
THROUGH THE TRAPDOOR 
 283 
Every time one of their men was lost, the white pieces showed 
no mercy. Soon there was a huddle of limp black players slumped 
along the wall. Twice, Ron only just noticed in time that Harry 
and Hermione were in danger. He himself darted around the 
board, taking almost as many white pieces as they had lost black 
ones. 
“We’re nearly there,” he muttered suddenly. “Let me think — 
let me think . . .” 
The white queen turned her blank face toward him. 
“Yes . . .” said Ron softly, “it’s the only way . . . I’ve got to be 
taken.” 
“NO!” Harry and Hermione shouted. 
“That’s chess!” snapped Ron. “You’ve got to make some sacrifices! I make my move and she’ll take me — that leaves you free 
to checkmate the king, Harry!” 
“But —” 
“Do you want to stop Snape or not?” 
“Ron —” 
“Look, if you don’t hurry up, he’ll already have the Stone!” 
There was no alternative. 
“Ready?” Ron called, his face pale but determined. “Here I 
go — now, don’t hang around once you’ve won.” 
He stepped forward, and the white queen pounced. She struck 
Ron hard across the head with her stone arm, and he crashed to the 
floor — Hermione screamed but stayed on her square — the white 
queen dragged Ron to one side. He looked as if he’d been knocked 
out. 
Shaking, Harry moved three spaces to the left. 
 CHAPTER SIXTEEN 
 284 
The white king took off his crown and threw it at Harry’s feet. 
They had won. The chessmen parted and bowed, leaving the door 
ahead clear. With one last desperate look back at Ron, Harry and 
Hermione charged through the door and up the next passageway. 
“What if he’s — ?” 
“He’ll be all right,” said Harry, trying to convince himself. 
“What do you reckon’s next?” 
“We’ve had Sprout’s, that was the Devil’s Snare; Flitwick must’ve 
put charms on the keys; McGonagall transfigured the chessmen to 
make them alive; that leaves Quirrell’s spell, and Snape’s . . .” 
They had reached another door. 
“All right?” Harry whispered. 
“Go on.” 
Harry pushed it open. 
A disgusting smell filled their nostrils, making both of them pull 
their robes up over their noses. Eyes watering, they saw, flat on the 
floor in front of them, a troll even larger than the one they had 
tackled, out cold with a bloody lump on its head. 
“I’m glad we didn’t have to fight that one,” Harry whispered as 
they stepped carefully over one of its massive legs. “Come on, I 
can’t breathe.” 
He pulled open the next door, both of them hardly daring to 
look at what came next — but there was nothing very frightening 
in here, just a table with seven differently shaped bottles standing 
on it in a line. 
“Snape’s,” said Harry. “What do we have to do?” 
They stepped over the threshold, and immediately a fire sprang 
up behind them in the doorway. It wasn’t ordinary fire either; it was 
THROUGH THE TRAPDOOR 
 285 
purple. At the same instant, black flames shot up in the doorway 
leading onward. They were trapped. 
“Look!” Hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to the bottles. 
Harry looked over her shoulder to read it: 
Danger lies before you, while safety lies behind,
Two of us will help you, whichever you would find,
One among us seven will let you move ahead,
Another will transport the drinker back instead,
Two among our number hold only nettle wine,
Three of us are killers, waiting hidden in line.
Choose, unless you wish to stay here forevermore,
To help you in your choice, we give you these clues four:
First, however slyly the poison tries to hide
You will always find some on nettle wine’s left side;
Second, different are those who stand at either end,
But if you would move onward, neither is your friend;
Third, as you see clearly, all are different size,
Neither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides;
Fourth, the second left and the second on the right
Are twins once you taste them, though different at first sight.
Hermione let out a great sigh and Harry, amazed, saw that she was 
smiling, the very last thing he felt like doing. 
“Brilliant,” said Hermione. “This isn’t magic — it’s logic — a 
puzzle. A lot of the greatest wizards haven’t got an ounce of logic, 
they’d be stuck in here forever.” 
“But so will we, won’t we?” 
 CHAPTER SIXTEEN 
 286 
“Of course not,” said Hermione. “Everything we need is here on 
this paper. Seven bottles: three are poison; two are wine; one will 
get us safely through the black fire, and one will get us back 
through the purple.” 
“But how do we know which to drink?” 
“Give me a minute.” 
Hermione read the paper several times. Then she walked up and 
down the line of bottles, muttering to herself and pointing at them. 
At last, she clapped her hands. 
“Got it,” she said. “The smallest bottle will get us through the 
black fire — toward the Stone.” 
Harry looked at the tiny bottle. 
“There’s only enough there for one of us,” he said. “That’s hardly 
one swallow.” 
They looked at each other. 
“Which one will get you back through the purple flames?” 
Hermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end of the 
line. 
“You drink that,” said Harry. “No, listen, get back and get Ron. 
Grab brooms from the flying-key room, they’ll get you out of the 
trapdoor and past Fluffy — go straight to the owlery and send 
Hedwig to Dumbledore, we need him. I might be able to hold 
Snape off for a while, but I’m no match for him, really.” 
“But Harry — what if You-Know-Who’s with him?” 
“Well — I was lucky once, wasn’t I?” said Harry, pointing at his 
scar. “I might get lucky again.” 
Hermione’s lip trembled, and she suddenly dashed at Harry and 
threw her arms around him. 
THROUGH THE TRAPDOOR 
 287 
“Hermione!” 
“Harry — you’re a great wizard, you know.” 
“I’m not as good as you,” said Harry, very embarrassed, as she let 
go of him. 
“Me!” said Hermione. “Books! And cleverness! There are more 
important things — friendship and bravery and — oh Harry — 
be careful!” 
“You drink first,” said Harry. “You are sure which is which, aren’t 
you?” 
“Positive,” said Hermione. She took a long drink from the 
round bottle at the end, and shuddered. 
“It’s not poison?” said Harry anxiously. 
“No — but it’s like ice.” 
“Quick, go, before it wears off.” 
“Good luck — take care —” 
“GO!” 
Hermione turned and walked straight through the purple fire. 
Harry took a deep breath and picked up the smallest bottle. He 
turned to face the black flames. 
“Here I come,” he said, and he drained the little bottle in one 
gulp. 
It was indeed as though ice was flooding his body. He put the 
bottle down and walked forward; he braced himself, saw the black 
flames licking his body, but couldn’t feel them — for a moment he 
could see nothing but dark fire — then he was on the other side, in 
the last chamber. 
There was already someone there — but it wasn’t Snape. It 
wasn’t even Voldemort. 
C H A P T E R S E V E N T E E N

t was Quirrell. 
“You!” gasped Harry. 
Quirrell smiled. His face wasn’t twitching at all. 
“Me,” he said calmly. “I wondered whether I’d be meeting you 
here, Potter.” 
“But I thought — Snape —” 
“Severus?” Quirrell laughed, and it wasn’t his usual quivering 
treble, either, but cold and sharp. “Yes, Severus does seem the type, 
doesn’t he? So useful to have him swooping around like an overgrown bat. Next to him, who would suspect p-p-poor, st-stuttering 
P-Professor Quirrell?” 
Harry couldn’t take it in. This couldn’t be true, it couldn’t. 
“But Snape tried to kill me!” 
“No, no, no. I tried to kill you. Your friend Miss Granger accidentally knocked me over as she rushed to set fire to Snape at that 
Quidditch match. She broke my eye contact with you. Another

few seconds and I’d have got you off that broom. I’d have managed 
it before then if Snape hadn’t been muttering a countercurse, trying to save you.” 
“Snape was trying to save me?” 
“Of course,” said Quirrell coolly. “Why do you think he wanted 
to referee your next match? He was trying to make sure I didn’t 
do it again. Funny, really . . . he needn’t have bothered. I couldn’t 
do anything with Dumbledore watching. All the other teachers 
thought Snape was trying to stop Gryffindor from winning, he did 
make himself unpopular . . . and what a waste of time, when after 
all that, I’m going to kill you tonight.” 
Quirrell snapped his fingers. Ropes sprang out of thin air and 
wrapped themselves tightly around Harry. 
“You’re too nosy to live, Potter. Scurrying around the school on 
Halloween like that, for all I knew you’d seen me coming to look at 
what was guarding the Stone.” 
“You let the troll in?” 
“Certainly. I have a special gift with trolls — you must have seen 
what I did to the one in the chamber back there? Unfortunately, 
while everyone else was running around looking for it, Snape, 
who already suspected me, went straight to the third floor to head 
me off — and not only did my troll fail to beat you to death, that 
three-headed dog didn’t even manage to bite Snape’s leg off 
properly. 
“Now, wait quietly, Potter. I need to examine this interesting 
mirror.” 
It was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind 
Quirrell. It was the Mirror of Erised. 
“This mirror is the key to finding the Stone,” Quirrell mur-
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN 
 290 
mured, tapping his way around the frame. “Trust Dumbledore to 
come up with something like this . . . but he’s in London . . . I’ll be 
far away by the time he gets back. . . .” 
All Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrell talking and 
stop him from concentrating on the mirror. 
“I saw you and Snape in the forest —” he blurted out. 
“Yes,” said Quirrell idly, walking around the mirror to look at 
the back. “He was on to me by that time, trying to find out how far 
I’d got. He suspected me all along. Tried to frighten me — as 
though he could, when I had Lord Voldemort on my side. . . .” 
Quirrell came back out from behind the mirror and stared hungrily into it. 
“I see the Stone . . . I’m presenting it to my master . . . but 
where is it?” 
Harry struggled against the ropes binding him, but they didn’t 
give. He had to keep Quirrell from giving his whole attention to 
the mirror. 
“But Snape always seemed to hate me so much.” 
“Oh, he does,” said Quirrell casually, “heavens, yes. He was at 
Hogwarts with your father, didn’t you know? They loathed each 
other. But he never wanted you dead.” 
“But I heard you a few days ago, sobbing — I thought Snape 
was threatening you. 
For the first time, a spasm of fear flitted across Quirrell’s face. 
“Sometimes,” he said, “I find it hard to follow my master’s instructions — he is a great wizard and I am weak —” 
“You mean he was there in the classroom with you?” Harry 
gasped. 
THE MAN 
WITH TWO FACES 
 291 
“He is with me wherever I go,” said Quirrell quietly. “I met 
him when I traveled around the world. A foolish young man I was 
then, full of ridiculous ideas about good and evil. Lord Voldemort 
showed me how wrong I was. There is no good and evil, there 
is only power, and those too weak to seek it. . . . Since then, I 
have served him faithfully, although I have let him down many 
times. He has had to be very hard on me.” Quirrell shivered suddenly. “He does not forgive mistakes easily. When I failed to 
steal the Stone from Gringotts, he was most displeased. He punished me . . . decided he would have to keep a closer watch on 
me. . . .” 
Quirrell’s voice trailed away. Harry was remembering his trip to 
Diagon Alley — how could he have been so stupid? He’d seen 
Quirrell there that very day, shaken hands with him in the Leaky 
Cauldron. 
Quirrell cursed under his breath. 
“I don’t understand . . . is the Stone inside the mirror? Should I 
break it?” 
Harry’s mind was racing. 
What I want more than anything else in the world at the moment, 
he thought, is to find the Stone before Quirrell does. So if I look in 
the mirror, I should see myself finding it — which means I’ll see where 
it’s hidden! But how can I look without Quirrell realizing what I’m 
up to? 
He tried to edge to the left, to get in front of the glass without 
Quirrell noticing, but the ropes around his ankles were too tight: 
he tripped and fell over. Quirrell ignored him. He was still talking 
to himself. 
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN 
 292 
“What does this mirror do? How does it work? Help me, 
Master!” 
And to Harry’s horror, a voice answered, and the voice seemed to 
come from Quirrell himself. 
“Use the boy . . . Use the boy . . .” 
Quirrell rounded on Harry. 
“Yes — Potter — come here.” 
He clapped his hands once, and the ropes binding Harry fell off. 
Harry got slowly to his feet. 
“Come here,” Quirrell repeated. “Look in the mirror and tell me 
what you see.” 
Harry walked toward him. 
I must lie, he thought desperately. I must look and lie about what 
I see, that’s all.
Quirrell moved close behind him. Harry breathed in the funny 
smell that seemed to come from Quirrell’s turban. He closed his 
eyes, stepped in front of the mirror, and opened them again. 
He saw his reflection, pale and scared-looking at first. But a moment later, the reflection smiled at him. It put its hand into its 
pocket and pulled out a blood-red stone. It winked and put the 
Stone back in its pocket — and as it did so, Harry felt something 
heavy drop into his real pocket. Somehow — incredibly — he’d 
gotten the Stone.
“Well?” said Quirrell impatiently. “What do you see?” 
Harry screwed up his courage. 
“I see myself shaking hands with Dumbledore,” he invented. 
“I — I’ve won the House Cup for Gryffindor.” 
Quirrell cursed again. 
THE MAN 
WITH TWO FACES 
 293 
“Get out of the way,” he said. As Harry moved aside, he felt the 
Sorcerer’s Stone against his leg. Dare he make a break for it? 
But he hadn’t walked five paces before a high voice spoke, 
though Quirrell wasn’t moving his lips. 
“He lies . . . He lies . . .” 
“Potter, come back here!” Quirrell shouted. “Tell me the truth! 
What did you just see?” 
The high voice spoke again. 
“Let me speak to him . . . face-to-face. . . .” 
“Master, you are not strong enough!” 
“I have strength enough . . . for this. . . .” 
Harry felt as if Devil’s Snare was rooting him to the spot. He 
couldn’t move a muscle. Petrified, he watched as Quirrell reached 
up and began to unwrap his turban. What was going on? The turban fell away. Quirrell’s head looked strangely small without it. 
Then he turned slowly on the spot. 
Harry would have screamed, but he couldn’t make a sound. 
Where there should have been a back to Quirrell’s head, there was 
a face, the most terrible face Harry had ever seen. It was chalk white 
with glaring red eyes and slits for nostrils, like a snake. 
“Harry Potter . . .” it whispered. 
Harry tried to take a step backward but his legs wouldn’t move. 
“See what I have become?” the face said. “Mere shadow and vapor . . . I have form only when I can share another’s body . . . but 
there have always been those willing to let me into their hearts 
and minds. . . . Unicorn blood has strengthened me, these past 
weeks . . . you saw faithful Quirrell drinking it for me in the forest . . . and once I have the Elixir of Life, I will be able to create a

 294 
body of my own. . . . Now . . . why don’t you give me that Stone in 
your pocket?” 
So he knew. The feeling suddenly surged back into Harry’s legs. 
He stumbled backward. 
“Don’t be a fool,” snarled the face. “Better save your own life and 
join me . . . or you’ll meet the same end as your parents. . . . They 
died begging me for mercy. . . .” 
“LIAR!” Harry shouted suddenly. 
Quirrell was walking backward at him, so that Voldemort could 
still see him. The evil face was now smiling. 
“How touching . . .” it hissed. “I always value bravery. . . . Yes, 
boy, your parents were brave. . . . I killed your father first, and 
he put up a courageous fight . . . but your mother needn’t have 
died . . . she was trying to protect you. . . . Now give me the Stone, 
unless you want her to have died in vain.” 
“NEVER!” 
Harry sprang toward the flame door, but Voldemort screamed 
“SEIZE HIM!” and the next second, Harry felt Quirrell’s hand 
close on his wrist. At once, a needle-sharp pain seared across 
Harry’s scar; his head felt as though it was about to split in two; he 
yelled, struggling with all his might, and to his surprise, Quirrell let 
go of him. The pain in his head lessened — he looked around 
wildly to see where Quirrell had gone, and saw him hunched in 
pain, looking at his fingers — they were blistering before his eyes. 
“Seize him! SEIZE HIM!” shrieked Voldemort again, and Quirrell lunged, knocking Harry clean off his feet, landing on top of 
him, both hands around Harry’s neck — Harry’s scar was almost 
blinding him with pain, yet he could see Quirrell howling in agony. 
THE MAN 
WITH TWO FACES 
 295 
“Master, I cannot hold him — my hands — my hands!” 
And Quirrell, though pinning Harry to the ground with his 
knees, let go of his neck and stared, bewildered, at his own 
palms — Harry could see they looked burned, raw, red, and shiny. 
“Then kill him, fool, and be done!” screeched Voldemort. 
Quirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly curse, but Harry, by 
instinct, reached up and grabbed Quirrell’s face — 
“AAAARGH!” 
Quirrell rolled off him, his face blistering, too, and then Harry 
knew: Quirrell couldn’t touch his bare skin, not without suffering 
terrible pain — his only chance was to keep hold of Quirrell, keep 
him in enough pain to stop him from doing a curse. 
Harry jumped to his feet, caught Quirrell by the arm, and hung 
on as tight as he could. Quirrell screamed and tried to throw Harry 
off — the pain in Harry’s head was building — he couldn’t see — 
he could only hear Quirrell’s terrible shrieks and Voldemort’s yells 
of, “KILL HIM! KILL HIM!” and other voices, maybe in Harry’s 
own head, crying, “Harry! Harry!” 
He felt Quirrell’s arm wrenched from his grasp, knew all was 
lost, and fell into blackness, down . . . down . . . down . . . 
Something gold was glinting just above him. The Snitch! He tried 
to catch it, but his arms were too heavy. 
He blinked. It wasn’t the Snitch at all. It was a pair of glasses. 
How strange. 
He blinked again. The smiling face of Albus Dumbledore swam 
into view above him. 
“Good afternoon, Harry,” said Dumbledore. 
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN 
 296 
Harry stared at him. Then he remembered: “Sir! The Stone! It 
was Quirrell! He’s got the Stone! Sir, quick —” 
“Calm yourself, dear boy, you are a little behind the times,” said 
Dumbledore. “Quirrell does not have the Stone.” 
“Then who does? Sir, I —” 
“Harry, please relax, or Madam Pomfrey will have me thrown 
out.” 
Harry swallowed and looked around him. He realized he must 
be in the hospital wing. He was lying in a bed with white linen 
sheets, and next to him was a table piled high with what looked like 
half the candy shop. 
“Tokens from your friends and admirers,” said Dumbledore, 
beaming. “What happened down in the dungeons between you 
and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret, so, naturally, the whole 
school knows. I believe your friends Misters Fred and George 
Weasley were responsible for trying to send you a toilet seat. No 
doubt they thought it would amuse you. Madam Pomfrey, however, felt it might not be very hygienic, and confiscated it.” 
“How long have I been in here?” 
“Three days. Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Granger will be 
most relieved you have come round, they have been extremely 
worried.” 
“But sir, the Stone —” 
“I see you are not to be distracted. Very well, the Stone. Professor Quirrell did not manage to take it from you. I arrived in time 
to prevent that, although you were doing very well on your own, I 
must say.” 
“You got there? You got Hermione’s owl?” 
THE MAN

 297 
“We must have crossed in midair. No sooner had I reached London than it became clear to me that the place I should be was the 
one I had just left. I arrived just in time to pull Quirrell off you —” 
“It was you.” 
“I feared I might be too late.” 
“You nearly were, I couldn’t have kept him off the Stone much 
longer —” 
“Not the Stone, boy, you — the effort involved nearly killed 
you. For one terrible moment there, I was afraid it had. As for the 
Stone, it has been destroyed.” 
“Destroyed?” said Harry blankly. “But your friend — Nicolas 
Flamel —” 
“Oh, you know about Nicolas?” said Dumbledore, sounding 
quite delighted. “You did do the thing properly, didn’t you? Well, 
Nicolas and I have had a little chat, and agreed it’s all for the 
best.” 
“But that means he and his wife will die, won’t they?” 
“They have enough Elixir stored to set their affairs in order and 
then, yes, they will die.” 
Dumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on Harry’s face. 
“To one as young as you, I’m sure it seems incredible, but to 
Nicolas and Perenelle, it really is like going to bed after a very, very 
long day. After all, to the well-organized mind, death is but the 
next great adventure. You know, the Stone was really not such a 
wonderful thing. As much money and life as you could want! The 
two things most human beings would choose above all — the trouble is, humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things 
that are worst for them.” 
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN 
 298 
Harry lay there, lost for words. Dumbledore hummed a little 
and smiled at the ceiling. 
“Sir?” said Harry. “I’ve been thinking . . . Sir — even if the 
Stone’s gone, Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who —” 
“Call him Voldemort, Harry. Always use the proper name for 
things. Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself.” 
“Yes, sir. Well, Voldemort’s going to try other ways of coming 
back, isn’t he? I mean, he hasn’t gone, has he?” 
“No, Harry, he has not. He is still out there somewhere, perhaps 
looking for another body to share . . . not being truly alive, he cannot be killed. He left Quirrell to die; he shows just as little mercy 
to his followers as his enemies. Nevertheless, Harry, while you may 
only have delayed his return to power, it will merely take someone 
else who is prepared to fight what seems a losing battle next 
time — and if he is delayed again, and again, why, he may never return to power.” 
Harry nodded, but stopped quickly, because it made his head 
hurt. Then he said, “Sir, there are some other things I’d like to 
know, if you can tell me . . . things I want to know the truth 
about. . . .” 
“The truth.” Dumbledore sighed. “It is a beautiful and terrible 
thing, and should therefore be treated with great caution. However, I shall answer your questions unless I have a very good reason not to, in which case I beg you’ll forgive me. I shall not, of 
course, lie.” 
“Well . . . Voldemort said that he only killed my mother because 
she tried to stop him from killing me. But why would he want to 
kill me in the first place?” 
THE MAN 
WITH TWO FACES 
 299 
Dumbledore sighed very deeply this time. 
“Alas, the first thing you ask me, I cannot tell you. Not today. 
Not now. You will know, one day . . . put it from your mind for 
now, Harry. When you are older . . . I know you hate to hear 
this . . . when you are ready, you will know.” 
And Harry knew it would be no good to argue. 
“But why couldn’t Quirrell touch me?” 
“Your mother died to save you. If there is one thing Voldemort 
cannot understand, it is love. He didn’t realize that love as powerful as your mother’s for you leaves its own mark. Not a scar, no 
visible sign . . . to have been loved so deeply, even though the person who loved us is gone, will give us some protection forever. It is 
in your very skin. Quirrell, full of hatred, greed, and ambition, 
sharing his soul with Voldemort, could not touch you for this reason. It was agony to touch a person marked by something so 
good.” 
Dumbledore now became very interested in a bird out on the 
windowsill, which gave Harry time to dry his eyes on the sheet. 
When he had found his voice again, Harry said, “And the Invisibility Cloak — do you know who sent it to me?” 
“Ah — your father happened to leave it in my possession, and I 
thought you might like it.” Dumbledore’s eyes twinkled. “Useful 
things . . . your father used it mainly for sneaking off to the 
kitchens to steal food when he was here.” 
“And there’s something else . . .” 
“Fire away.” 
“Quirrell said Snape —” 
“Professor Snape, Harry.” 
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN 
 300 
“Yes, him — Quirrell said he hates me because he hated my father. Is that true?” 
“Well, they did rather detest each other. Not unlike yourself and 
Mr. Malfoy. And then, your father did something Snape could 
never forgive.” 
“What?” 
“He saved his life.” 
“What?” 
“Yes . . .” said Dumbledore dreamily. “Funny, the way people’s 
minds work, isn’t it? Professor Snape couldn’t bear being in your father’s debt. . . . I do believe he worked so hard to protect you this 
year because he felt that would make him and your father even. 
Then he could go back to hating your father’s memory in 
peace. . . .” 
Harry tried to understand this but it made his head pound, so he 
stopped. 
“And sir, there’s one more thing . . .” 
“Just the one?” 
“How did I get the Stone out of the mirror?” 
“Ah, now, I’m glad you asked me that. It was one of my more 
brilliant ideas, and between you and me, that’s saying something. 
You see, only one who wanted to find the Stone — find it, but not 
use it — would be able to get it, otherwise they’d just see themselves making gold or drinking Elixir of Life. My brain surprises 
even me sometimes. . . . Now, enough questions. I suggest you 
make a start on these sweets. Ah! Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans! 
I was unfortunate enough in my youth to come across a vomitflavored one, and since then I’m afraid I’ve rather lost my liking for 
them — but I think I’ll be safe with a nice toffee, don’t you?” 
THE MAN 
WITH TWO FACES 
 301 
He smiled and popped the golden-brown bean into his mouth. 
Then he choked and said, “Alas! Ear wax!” 
Madam Pomfrey, the nurse, was a nice woman, but very strict. 
“Just five minutes,” Harry pleaded. 
“Absolutely not.” 
“You let Professor Dumbledore in. . . .” 
“Well, of course, that was the headmaster, quite different. You 
need rest.” 
“I am resting, look, lying down and everything. Oh, go on, 
Madam Pomfrey . . .” 
“Oh, very well,” she said. “But five minutes only.” 
And she let Ron and Hermione in. 
“Harry!” 
Hermione looked ready to fling her arms around him again, but 
Harry was glad she held herself in as his head was still very sore. 
“Oh, Harry, we were sure you were going to — Dumbledore 
was so worried —” 
“The whole school’s talking about it,” said Ron. “What really 
happened?” 
It was one of those rare occasions when the true story is even 
more strange and exciting than the wild rumors. Harry told them 
everything: Quirrell; the mirror; the Stone; and Voldemort. Ron 
and Hermione were a very good audience; they gasped in all the 
right places, and when Harry told them what was under Quirrell’s 
turban, Hermione screamed out loud. 
“So the Stone’s gone?” said Ron finally. “Flamel’s just going to 
die?” 
“That’s what I said, but Dumbledore thinks that — what was 
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN 
 302 
it? — ‘to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.’ ” 
“I always said he was off his rocker,” said Ron, looking quite impressed at how crazy his hero was. 
“So what happened to you two?” said Harry. 
“Well, I got back all right,” said Hermione. “I brought Ron 
round — that took a while — and we were dashing up to the 
owlery to contact Dumbledore when we met him in the entrance 
hall — he already knew — he just said, ‘Harry’s gone after him, 
hasn’t he?’ and hurtled off to the third floor.” 
“D’you think he meant you to do it?” said Ron. “Sending you 
your fathers cloak and everything?” 
“Well,” Hermione exploded, “if he did — I mean to say — that’s 
terrible — you could have been killed.” 
“No, it isn’t,” said Harry thoughtfully. “He’s a funny man, Dumbledore. I think he sort of wanted to give me a chance. I think he 
knows more or less everything that goes on here, you know. I 
reckon he had a pretty good idea we were going to try, and instead 
of stopping us, he just taught us enough to help. I don’t think it 
was an accident he let me find out how the mirror worked. It’s almost like he thought I had the right to face Voldemort if I 
could. . . .” 
“Yeah, Dumbledore’s off his rocker, all right,” said Ron proudly. 
“Listen, you’ve got to be up for the end-of-year feast tomorrow. 
The points are all in and Slytherin won, of course — you missed 
the last Quidditch match, we were steamrollered by Ravenclaw 
without you — but the food’ll be good.” 
At that moment, Madam Pomfrey bustled over. 
“You’ve had nearly fifteen minutes, now OUT,” she said firmly. 
THE MAN 
WITH TWO FACES 
 303 
  
After a good night’s sleep, Harry felt nearly back to normal. 
“I want to go to the feast,” he told Madam Pomfrey as she 
straightened his many candy boxes. “I can, can’t I?” 
“Professor Dumbledore says you are to be allowed to go,” she said 
sniffily, as though in her opinion Professor Dumbledore didn’t 
realize how risky feasts could be. “And you have another visitor.” 
“Oh, good,” said Harry. “Who is it?” 
Hagrid sidled through the door as he spoke. As usual when he 
was indoors, Hagrid looked too big to be allowed. He sat down 
next to Harry, took one look at him, and burst into tears. 
“It’s — all — my — ruddy — fault!” he sobbed, his face in his 
hands. “I told the evil git how ter get past Fluffy! I told him! It was 
the only thing he didn’t know, an’ I told him! Yeh could’ve died! All 
fer a dragon egg! I’ll never drink again! I should be chucked out an’ 
made ter live as a Muggle!” 
“Hagrid!” said Harry, shocked to see Hagrid shaking with grief 
and remorse, great tears leaking down into his beard. “Hagrid, he’d 
have found out somehow, this is Voldemort we’re talking about, 
he’d have found out even if you hadn’t told him.” 
“Yeh could’ve died!” sobbed Hagrid. “An’ don’ say the name!” 
“VOLDEMORT!” Harry bellowed, and Hagrid was so shocked, 
he stopped crying. “I’ve met him and I’m calling him by his name. 
Please cheer up, Hagrid, we saved the Stone, it’s gone, he can’t use 
it. Have a Chocolate Frog, I’ve got loads. . . .” 
Hagrid wiped his nose on the back of his hand and said, “That 
reminds me. I’ve got yeh a present.” 
“It’s not a stoat sandwich, is it?” said Harry anxiously, and at last 
Hagrid gave a weak chuckle. 
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN 
 304 
“Nah. Dumbledore gave me the day off yesterday ter fix it. 
’Course, he shoulda sacked me instead — anyway, got yeh this . . .” 
It seemed to be a handsome, leather-covered book. Harry opened 
it curiously. It was full of wizard photographs. Smiling and waving 
at him from every page were his mother and father. 
“Sent owls off ter all yer parents’ old school friends, askin’ fer 
photos . . . knew yeh didn’ have any . . . d’yeh like it?” 
Harry couldn’t speak, but Hagrid understood. 
Harry made his way down to the end-of-year feast alone that night. 
He had been held up by Madam Pomfrey’s fussing about, insisting 
on giving him one last checkup, so the Great Hall was already full. 
It was decked out in the Slytherin colors of green and silver to celebrate Slytherin’s winning the House Cup for the seventh year in a 
row. A huge banner showing the Slytherin serpent covered the wall 
behind the High Table. 
When Harry walked in there was a sudden hush, and then 
everybody started talking loudly at once. He slipped into a seat between Ron and Hermione at the Gryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that people were standing up to look at him. 
Fortunately, Dumbledore arrived moments later. The babble 
died away. 
“Another year gone!” Dumbledore said cheerfully. “And I must 
trouble you with an old man’s wheezing waffle before we sink our 
teeth into our delicious feast. What a year it has been! Hopefully 
your heads are all a little fuller than they were . . . you have the 
whole summer ahead to get them nice and empty before next year 
starts. . . . 
THE MAN 
WITH TWO FACES 
 305 
“Now, as I understand it, the House Cup here needs awarding, 
and the points stand thus: In fourth place, Gryffindor, with three 
hundred and twelve points; in third, Hufflepuff, with three hundred and fifty-two; Ravenclaw has four hundred and twenty-six and 
Slytherin, four hundred and seventy-two.” 
A storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the Slytherin 
table. Harry could see Draco Malfoy banging his goblet on the 
table. It was a sickening sight. 
“Yes, yes, well done, Slytherin,” said Dumbledore. “However, recent events must be taken into account.” 
The room went very still. The Slytherins’ smiles faded a little. 
“Ahem,” said Dumbledore. “I have a few last-minute points to 
dish out. Let me see. Yes . . . 
“First — to Mr. Ronald Weasley . . .” 
Ron went purple in the face; he looked like a radish with a bad 
sunburn. 
“. . . for the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in 
many years, I award Gryffindor House fifty points.” 
Gryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling; the stars 
overhead seemed to quiver. Percy could be heard telling the other 
prefects, “My brother, you know! My youngest brother! Got past 
McGonagall’s giant chess set!” 
At last there was silence again. 
“Second — to Miss Hermione Granger . . . for the use of cool 
logic in the face of fire, I award Gryffindor House fifty points.” 
Hermione buried her face in her arms; Harry strongly suspected 
she had burst into tears. Gryffindors up and down the table were 
beside themselves — they were a hundred points up. 
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN 
 306 
“Third — to Mr. Harry Potter . . .” said Dumbledore. The room 
went deadly quiet. “. . . for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I 
award Gryffindor House sixty points.” 
The din was deafening. Those who could add up while yelling 
themselves hoarse knew that Gryffindor now had four hundred 
and seventy-two points — exactly the same as Slytherin. They had 
tied for the House Cup — if only Dumbledore had given Harry just 
one more point. 
Dumbledore raised his hand. The room gradually fell silent. 
“There are all kinds of courage,” said Dumbledore, smiling. “It 
takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as 
much to stand up to our friends. I therefore award ten points to 
Mr. Neville Longbottom.” 
Someone standing outside the Great Hall might well have 
thought some sort of explosion had taken place, so loud was the 
noise that erupted from the Gryffindor table. Harry, Ron, and 
Hermione stood up to yell and cheer as Neville, white with shock, 
disappeared under a pile of people hugging him. He had never won 
so much as a point for Gryffindor before. Harry, still cheering, 
nudged Ron in the ribs and pointed at Malfoy, who couldn’t have 
looked more stunned and horrified if he’d just had the Body-Bind 
Curse put on him. 
“Which means,” Dumbledore called over the storm of applause, 
for even Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were celebrating the downfall 
of Slytherin, “we need a little change of decoration.” 
He clapped his hands. In an instant, the green hangings became 
scarlet and the silver became gold; the huge Slytherin serpent vanished and a towering Gryffindor lion took its place. Snape was 
THE MAN 
WITH TWO FACES 
 307 
shaking Professor McGonagall’s hand, with a horrible, forced 
smile. He caught Harry’s eye and Harry knew at once that Snape’s 
feelings toward him hadn’t changed one jot. This didn’t worry 
Harry. It seemed as though life would be back to normal next year, 
or as normal as it ever was at Hogwarts. 
It was the best evening of Harry’s life, better than winning at 
Quidditch, or Christmas, or knocking out mountain trolls . . . he 
would never, ever forget tonight. 
Harry had almost forgotten that the exam results were still to 
come, but come they did. To their great surprise, both he and Ron 
passed with good marks; Hermione, of course, had the best grades 
of the first years. Even Neville scraped through, his good Herbology mark making up for his abysmal Potions one. They had hoped 
that Goyle, who was almost as stupid as he was mean, might be 
thrown out, but he had passed, too. It was a shame, but as Ron 
said, you couldn’t have everything in life. 
And suddenly, their wardrobes were empty, their trunks were 
packed, Neville’s toad was found lurking in a corner of the toilets; 
notes were handed out to all students, warning them not to use 
magic over the holidays (“I always hope they’ll forget to give us 
these,” said Fred Weasley sadly); Hagrid was there to take them 
down to the fleet of boats that sailed across the lake; they were 
boarding the Hogwarts Express; talking and laughing as the countryside became greener and tidier; eating Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor 
Beans as they sped past Muggle towns; pulling off their wizard 
robes and putting on jackets and coats; pulling into platform nine 
and three-quarters at King’s Cross station. 
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN 
 308 
It took quite a while for them all to get off the platform. A wizened old guard was up by the ticket barrier, letting them go 
through the gate in twos and threes so they didn’t attract attention by all bursting out of a solid wall at once and alarming the 
Muggles. 
“You must come and stay this summer,” said Ron, “both of 
you — I’ll send you an owl.” 
“Thanks,” said Harry, “I’ll need something to look forward to.” 
People jostled them as they moved forward toward the gateway 
back to the Muggle world. Some of them called: 
“Bye, Harry!” 
“See you, Potter!” 
“Still famous,” said Ron, grinning at him. 
“Not where I’m going, I promise you,” said Harry. 
He, Ron, and Hermione passed through the gateway together. 
“There he is, Mom, there he is, look!” 
It was Ginny Weasley, Ron’s younger sister, but she wasn’t pointing at Ron. 
“Harry Potter!” she squealed. “Look, Mom! I can see —” 
“Be quiet, Ginny, and it’s rude to point.” 
Mrs. Weasley smiled down at them. 
“Busy year?” she said. 
“Very,” said Harry. “Thanks for the fudge and the sweater, Mrs. 
Weasley.” 
“Oh, it was nothing, dear.” 
“Ready, are you?” 
It was Uncle Vernon, still purple-faced, still mustached, still 
looking furious at the nerve of Harry, carrying an owl in a cage in 
THE MAN 
WITH TWO FACES 
 309 
a station full of ordinary people. Behind him stood Aunt Petunia 
and Dudley, looking terrified at the very sight of Harry. 
“You must be Harry’s family!” said Mrs. Weasley. 
“In a manner of speaking,” said Uncle Vernon. “Hurry up, boy, 
we haven’t got all day.” He walked away. 
Harry hung back for a last word with Ron and Hermione. 
“See you over the summer, then.” 
“Hope you have — er — a good holiday,” said Hermione, looking uncertainly after Uncle Vernon, shocked that anyone could be 
so unpleasant. 
“Oh, I will,” said Harry, and they were surprised at the grin that 
was spreading over his face. “They don’t know we’re not allowed to 
use magic at home. I’m going to have a lot of fun with Dudley this 
summer. . . .”

Pride and Prejudice
By
Jane Austen
Chapter 1
It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a
good fortune, must be in want of a wife.
However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his
first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the
surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property of some one or
other of their daughters.
“My dear Mr. Bennet,” said his lady to him one day, “have you heard that
Netherfield Park is let at last?”
Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.
“But it is,” returned she; “for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told
me all about it.”
Mr. Bennet made no answer.
“Do you not want to know who has taken it?” cried his wife impatiently.
“You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.”
This was invitation enough.
“Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken
by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came
down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much
delighted with it, that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to
take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the
house by the end of next week.”
“What is his name?”
“Bingley.”
“Is he married or single?”
“Oh! Single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or
five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!”
“How so? How can it affect them?”
“My dear Mr. Bennet,” replied his wife, “how can you be so tiresome! You
must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.”
“Is that his design in settling here?”
“Design! Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may
fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he
comes.”
“I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send
them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are as
handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley may like you the best of the party.”
“My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do
not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five grownup daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.”
“In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.”
“But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes
into the neighbourhood.”
“It is more than I engage for, I assure you.”
“But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would
be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely
on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed
you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him if you do not.”
“You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad
to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty
consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must
throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.”
“I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others;
and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good-humoured
as Lydia. But you are always giving her the preference.”
“They have none of them much to recommend them,” replied he; “they are
all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of
quickness than her sisters.”
“Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You
take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves.”
“You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are
my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these last
twenty years at least.”
“Ah, you do not know what I suffer.”
“But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four
thousand a year come into the neighbourhood.”
“It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not visit
them.”
“Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them all.”
Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour, reserve,
and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had been
insufficient to make his wife understand his character. Her mind was less
difficult to develop. She was a woman of mean understanding, little
information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented, she fancied
herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her daughters married; its
solace was visiting and news.
Chapter 2
Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley. He
had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his wife
that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was paid she had no
knowledge of it. It was then disclosed in the following manner. Observing his
second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly addressed her with:
“I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.”
“We are not in a way to know what Mr. Bingley likes,” said her mother
resentfully, “since we are not to visit.”
“But you forget, mamma,” said Elizabeth, “that we shall meet him at the
assemblies, and that Mrs. Long promised to introduce him.”
“I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two nieces of
her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion of her.”
“No more have I,” said Mr. Bennet; “and I am glad to find that you do not
depend on her serving you.”
Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply, but, unable to contain herself,
began scolding one of her daughters.
“Don’t keep coughing so, Kitty, for Heaven’s sake! Have a little
compassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces.”
“Kitty has no discretion in her coughs,” said her father; “she times them
ill.”
“I do not cough for my own amusement,” replied Kitty fretfully. “When is
your next ball to be, Lizzy?”
“To-morrow fortnight.”
“Aye, so it is,” cried her mother, “and Mrs. Long does not come back till
the day before; so it will be impossible for her to introduce him, for she will
not know him herself.”
“Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce
Mr. Bingley to her.”
“Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him
myself; how can you be so teasing?”
“I honour your circumspection. A fortnight’s acquaintance is certainly very
little. One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight. But if
we do not venture somebody else will; and after all, Mrs. Long and her nieces
must stand their chance; and, therefore, as she will think it an act of kindness,
if you decline the office, I will take it on myself.”
The girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only, “Nonsense,
nonsense!”
“What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?” cried he. “Do
you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on them, as
nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you there. What say you, Mary? For you
are a young lady of deep reflection, I know, and read great books and make
extracts.”
Mary wished to say something sensible, but knew not how.
“While Mary is adjusting her ideas,” he continued, “let us return to Mr.
Bingley.”
“I am sick of Mr. Bingley,” cried his wife.
“I am sorry to hear that; but why did not you tell me that before? If I had
known as much this morning I certainly would not have called on him. It is
very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we cannot escape the
acquaintance now.”
The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of Mrs.
Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though, when the first tumult of joy was
over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while.
“How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should
persuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such
an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! and it is such a good joke, too, that
you should have gone this morning and never said a word about it till now.”
“Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,” said Mr. Bennet;
and, as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.
“What an excellent father you have, girls!” said she, when the door was
shut. “I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness; or
me, either, for that matter. At our time of life it is not so pleasant, I can tell
you, to be making new acquaintances every day; but for your sakes, we would
do anything. Lydia, my love, though you are the youngest, I dare say Mr.
Bingley will dance with you at the next ball.”
“Oh!” said Lydia stoutly, “I am not afraid; for though I am the youngest,
I’m the tallest.”
The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would
return Mr. Bennet’s visit, and determining when they should ask him to dinner.
Chapter 3
Not all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five
daughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw from her husband
any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley. They attacked him in various ways
—with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and distant surmises; but
he eluded the skill of them all, and they were at last obliged to accept the
second-hand intelligence of their neighbour, Lady Lucas. Her report was
highly favourable. Sir William had been delighted with him. He was quite
young, wonderfully handsome, extremely agreeable, and, to crown the whole,
he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party. Nothing could be more
delightful! To be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love;
and very lively hopes of Mr. Bingley’s heart were entertained.
“If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield,” said
Mrs. Bennet to her husband, “and all the others equally well married, I shall
have nothing to wish for.”
In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet’s visit, and sat about ten
minutes with him in his library. He had entertained hopes of being admitted to
a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard much; but he saw
only the father. The ladies were somewhat more fortunate, for they had the
advantage of ascertaining from an upper window that he wore a blue coat, and
rode a black horse.
An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already had
Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping,
when an answer arrived which deferred it all. Mr. Bingley was obliged to be in
town the following day, and, consequently, unable to accept the honour of
their invitation, etc. Mrs. Bennet was quite disconcerted. She could not
imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in
Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from
one place to another, and never settled at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady
Lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to London
only to get a large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr.
Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the
assembly. The girls grieved over such a number of ladies, but were comforted
the day before the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve he brought only six
with him from London—his five sisters and a cousin. And when the party
entered the assembly room it consisted of only five altogether—Mr. Bingley,
his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young man.
Mr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasant
countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine women, with
an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely looked the
gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his
fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and the report which was in
general circulation within five minutes after his entrance, of his having ten
thousand a year. The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man,
the ladies declared he was much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was
looked at with great admiration for about half the evening, till his manners
gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to
be proud; to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his
large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding,
disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his friend.
Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal
people in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance, was
angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one himself at
Netherfield. Such amiable qualities must speak for themselves. What a
contrast between him and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced only once with Mrs.
Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being introduced to any other
lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room, speaking
occasionally to one of his own party. His character was decided. He was the
proudest, most disagreeable man in the world, and everybody hoped that he
would never come there again. Amongst the most violent against him was
Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into
particular resentment by his having slighted one of her daughters.
Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit
down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr. Darcy had been
standing near enough for her to hear a conversation between him and Mr.
Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his friend to
join it.
“Come, Darcy,” said he, “I must have you dance. I hate to see you standing
about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much better dance.”
“I certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am particularly
acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as this it would be
insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and there is not another woman in the
room whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with.”
“I would not be so fastidious as you are,” cried Mr. Bingley, “for a
kingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in my life
as I have this evening; and there are several of them you see uncommonly
pretty.”
“You are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,” said Mr.
Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.
“Oh! She is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there is one of
her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I dare say very
agreeable. Do let me ask my partner to introduce you.”
“Which do you mean?” and turning round he looked for a moment at
Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said: “She is
tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt me; I am in no humour at present
to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men. You had
better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles, for you are wasting your
time with me.”
Mr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth
remained with no very cordial feelings toward him. She told the story,
however, with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively, playful
disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous.
The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. Mrs.
Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield party.
Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been distinguished by his
sisters. Jane was as much gratified by this as her mother could be, though in a
quieter way. Elizabeth felt Jane’s pleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned
to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and
Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough never to be without partners,
which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball. They returned,
therefore, in good spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of
which they were the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up.
With a book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a
good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such
splendid expectations. He had rather hoped that his wife’s views on the
stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found out that he had a different
story to hear.
“Oh! my dear Mr. Bennet,” as she entered the room, “we have had a most
delightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had been there. Jane was
so admired, nothing could be like it. Everybody said how well she looked; and
Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with her twice! Only think
of that, my dear; he actually danced with her twice! and she was the only
creature in the room that he asked a second time. First of all, he asked Miss
Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand up with her! But, however, he did not
admire her at all; indeed, nobody can, you know; and he seemed quite struck
with Jane as she was going down the dance. So he inquired who she was, and
got introduced, and asked her for the two next. Then the two third he danced
with Miss King, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with
Jane again, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the Boulanger—”
“If he had had any compassion for me,” cried her husband impatiently, “he
would not have danced half so much! For God’s sake, say no more of his
partners. Oh that he had sprained his ankle in the first dance!”
“Oh! my dear, I am quite delighted with him. He is so excessively
handsome! And his sisters are charming women. I never in my life saw
anything more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the lace upon Mrs. Hurst’s
gown—”
Here she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against any
description of finery. She was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the
subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration, the
shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.
“But I can assure you,” she added, “that Lizzy does not lose much by not
suiting his fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at all worth
pleasing. So high and so conceited that there was no enduring him! He walked
here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very great! Not handsome
enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, my dear, to have given him
one of your set-downs. I quite detest the man.”
Chapter 4
When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in
her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister just how very much
she admired him.
“He is just what a young man ought to be,” said she, “sensible, goodhumoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!—so much ease, with
such perfect good breeding!”
“He is also handsome,” replied Elizabeth, “which a young man ought
likewise to be, if he possibly can. His character is thereby complete.”
“I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time. I did
not expect such a compliment.”
“Did not you? I did for you. But that is one great difference between us.
Compliments always take you by surprise, and me never. What could be more
natural than his asking you again? He could not help seeing that you were
about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room. No thanks to his
gallantry for that. Well, he certainly is very agreeable, and I give you leave to
like him. You have liked many a stupider person.”
“Dear Lizzy!”
“Oh! you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in general. You
never see a fault in anybody. All the world are good and agreeable in your
eyes. I never heard you speak ill of a human being in your life.”
“I would not wish to be hasty in censuring anyone; but I always speak
what I think.”
“I know you do; and it is that which makes the wonder. With your good
sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others! Affectation
of candour is common enough—one meets with it everywhere. But to be
candid without ostentation or design—to take the good of everybody’s
character and make it still better, and say nothing of the bad—belongs to you
alone. And so you like this man’s sisters, too, do you? Their manners are not
equal to his.”
“Certainly not—at first. But they are very pleasing women when you
converse with them. Miss Bingley is to live with her brother, and keep his
house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour
in her.”
Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behaviour at the
assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more
quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and with a
judgement too unassailed by any attention to herself, she was very little
disposed to approve them. They were in fact very fine ladies; not deficient in
good humour when they were pleased, nor in the power of making themselves
agreeable when they chose it, but proud and conceited. They were rather
handsome, had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town,
had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds, were in the habit of spending more
than they ought, and of associating with people of rank, and were therefore in
every respect entitled to think well of themselves, and meanly of others. They
were of a respectable family in the north of England; a circumstance more
deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother’s fortune and their
own had been acquired by trade.
Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred thousand
pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate, but did not
live to do it. Mr. Bingley intended it likewise, and sometimes made choice of
his county; but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a
manor, it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his
temper, whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at Netherfield,
and leave the next generation to purchase.
His sisters were anxious for his having an estate of his own; but, though he
was now only established as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no means
unwilling to preside at his table—nor was Mrs. Hurst, who had married a man
of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider his house as her home
when it suited her. Mr. Bingley had not been of age two years, when he was
tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House. He
did look at it, and into it for half-an-hour—was pleased with the situation and
the principal rooms, satisfied with what the owner said in its praise, and took it
immediately.
Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of
great opposition of character. Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the easiness,
openness, and ductility of his temper, though no disposition could offer a
greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he never appeared
dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy’s regard, Bingley had the firmest
reliance, and of his judgement the highest opinion. In understanding, Darcy
was the superior. Bingley was by no means deficient, but Darcy was clever. He
was at the same time haughty, reserved, and fastidious, and his manners,
though well-bred, were not inviting. In that respect his friend had greatly the
advantage. Bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was
continually giving offense.
The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently
characteristic. Bingley had never met with more pleasant people or prettier
girls in his life; everybody had been most kind and attentive to him; there had
been no formality, no stiffness; he had soon felt acquainted with all the room;
and, as to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel more beautiful. Darcy,
on the contrary, had seen a collection of people in whom there was little
beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and
from none received either attention or pleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged
to be pretty, but she smiled too much.
Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so—but still they admired her
and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom they
would not object to know more of. Miss Bennet was therefore established as a
sweet girl, and their brother felt authorized by such commendation to think of
her as he chose.
Chapter 5
Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets
were particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade in
Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to the honour of
knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty. The distinction had
perhaps been felt too strongly. It had given him a disgust to his business, and
to his residence in a small market town; and, in quitting them both, he had
removed with his family to a house about a mile from Meryton, denominated
from that period Lucas Lodge, where he could think with pleasure of his own
importance, and, unshackled by business, occupy himself solely in being civil
to all the world. For, though elated by his rank, it did not render him
supercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention to everybody. By nature
inoffensive, friendly, and obliging, his presentation at St. James’s had made
him courteous.
Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a
valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet. They had several children. The eldest of
them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven, was
Elizabeth’s intimate friend.
That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a ball
was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly brought the
former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.
“You began the evening well, Charlotte,” said Mrs. Bennet with civil selfcommand to Miss Lucas. “You were Mr. Bingley’s first choice.”
“Yes; but he seemed to like his second better.”
“Oh! you mean Jane, I suppose, because he danced with her twice. To be
sure that did seem as if he admired her—indeed I rather believe he did—I
heard something about it—but I hardly know what—something about Mr.
Robinson.”
“Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson; did
not I mention it to you? Mr. Robinson’s asking him how he liked our Meryton
assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty
women in the room, and which he thought the prettiest? and his answering
immediately to the last question: ‘Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet, beyond a doubt;
there cannot be two opinions on that point.’”
“Upon my word! Well, that is very decided indeed—that does seem as if—
but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know.”
“My overhearings were more to the purpose than yours, Eliza,” said
Charlotte. “Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend, is he?—
poor Eliza!—to be only just tolerable.”
“I beg you would not put it into Lizzy’s head to be vexed by his illtreatment, for he is such a disagreeable man, that it would be quite a
misfortune to be liked by him. Mrs. Long told me last night that he sat close to
her for half-an-hour without once opening his lips.”
“Are you quite sure, ma’am?—is not there a little mistake?” said Jane. “I
certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her.”
“Aye—because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he
could not help answering her; but she said he seemed quite angry at being
spoke to.”
“Miss Bingley told me,” said Jane, “that he never speaks much, unless
among his intimate acquaintances. With them he is remarkably agreeable.”
“I do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he had been so very agreeable, he
would have talked to Mrs. Long. But I can guess how it was; everybody says
that he is eat up with pride, and I dare say he had heard somehow that Mrs.
Long does not keep a carriage, and had come to the ball in a hack chaise.”
“I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long,” said Miss Lucas, “but I wish
he had danced with Eliza.”
“Another time, Lizzy,” said her mother, “I would not dance with him, if I
were you.”
“I believe, ma’am, I may safely promise you never to dance with him.”
“His pride,” said Miss Lucas, “does not offend me so much as pride often
does, because there is an excuse for it. One cannot wonder that so very fine a
young man, with family, fortune, everything in his favour, should think highly
of himself. If I may so express it, he has a right to be proud.”
“That is very true,” replied Elizabeth, “and I could easily forgive his pride,
if he had not mortified mine.”
“Pride,” observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her
reflections, “is a very common failing, I believe. By all that I have ever read, I
am convinced that it is very common indeed; that human nature is particularly
prone to it, and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of
self-complacency on the score of some quality or other, real or imaginary.
Vanity and pride are different things, though the words are often used
synonymously. A person may be proud without being vain. Pride relates more
to our opinion of ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us.”
“If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy,” cried a young Lucas, who came with his
sisters, “I should not care how proud I was. I would keep a pack of foxhounds,
and drink a bottle of wine a day.”
“Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought,” said Mrs.
Bennet; “and if I were to see you at it, I should take away your bottle directly.”
The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she
would, and the argument ended only with the visit.
Chapter 6
The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield. The visit
was soon returned in due form. Miss Bennet’s pleasing manners grew on the
goodwill of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was found to
be intolerable, and the younger sisters not worth speaking to, a wish of being
better acquainted with them was expressed towards the two eldest. By Jane,
this attention was received with the greatest pleasure, but Elizabeth still saw
superciliousness in their treatment of everybody, hardly excepting even her
sister, and could not like them; though their kindness to Jane, such as it was,
had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother’s
admiration. It was generally evident whenever they met, that he did admire her
and to her it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference
which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a way to be
very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be
discovered by the world in general, since Jane united, with great strength of
feeling, a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner which
would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent. She mentioned this to
her friend Miss Lucas.
“It may perhaps be pleasant,” replied Charlotte, “to be able to impose on
the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very
guarded. If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object
of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and it will then be but poor
consolation to believe the world equally in the dark. There is so much of
gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment, that it is not safe to leave any
to itself. We can all begin freely—a slight preference is natural enough; but
there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without
encouragement. In nine cases out of ten a women had better show more
affection than she feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he may
never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.”
“But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If I can
perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton, indeed, not to discover it
too.”
“Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane’s disposition as you do.”
“But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal it,
he must find it out.”
“Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But, though Bingley and Jane
meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and, as they always
see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that every moment
should be employed in conversing together. Jane should therefore make the
most of every half-hour in which she can command his attention. When she is
secure of him, there will be more leisure for falling in love as much as she
chooses.”
“Your plan is a good one,” replied Elizabeth, “where nothing is in question
but the desire of being well married, and if I were determined to get a rich
husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it. But these are not Jane’s
feelings; she is not acting by design. As yet, she cannot even be certain of the
degree of her own regard nor of its reasonableness. She has known him only a
fortnight. She danced four dances with him at Meryton; she saw him one
morning at his own house, and has since dined with him in company four
times. This is not quite enough to make her understand his character.”
“Not as you represent it. Had she merely dined with him, she might only
have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must remember that
four evenings have also been spent together—and four evenings may do a
great deal.”
“Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both
like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to any other leading
characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded.”
“Well,” said Charlotte, “I wish Jane success with all my heart; and if she
were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a chance of
happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth.
Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. If the dispositions of the
parties are ever so well known to each other or ever so similar beforehand, it
does not advance their felicity in the least. They always continue to grow
sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation; and it is better to
know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to
pass your life.”
“You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound. You know it is not
sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.”
Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley’s attentions to her sister, Elizabeth was
far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest
in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be
pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the ball; and when they next
met, he looked at her only to criticise. But no sooner had he made it clear to
himself and his friends that she hardly had a good feature in her face, than he
began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful
expression of her dark eyes. To this discovery succeeded some others equally
mortifying. Though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure
of perfect symmetry in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to
be light and pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not
those of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness. Of
this she was perfectly unaware; to her he was only the man who made himself
agreeable nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance
with.
He began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversing
with her himself, attended to her conversation with others. His doing so drew
her notice. It was at Sir William Lucas’s, where a large party were assembled.
“What does Mr. Darcy mean,” said she to Charlotte, “by listening to my
conversation with Colonel Forster?”
“That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.”
“But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see what he
is about. He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by being impertinent
myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him.”
On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have
any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such a
subject to him; which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she turned to
him and said:
“Did you not think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly well
just now, when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at Meryton?”
“With great energy; but it is always a subject which makes a lady
energetic.”
“You are severe on us.”
“It will be her turn soon to be teased,” said Miss Lucas. “I am going to
open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows.”
“You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!—always wanting me
to play and sing before anybody and everybody! If my vanity had taken a
musical turn, you would have been invaluable; but as it is, I would really
rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very
best performers.” On Miss Lucas’s persevering, however, she added, “Very
well, if it must be so, it must.” And gravely glancing at Mr. Darcy, “There is a
fine old saying, which everybody here is of course familiar with: ‘Keep your
breath to cool your porridge’; and I shall keep mine to swell my song.”
Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital. After a song
or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would
sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister Mary,
who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in the family, worked
hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always impatient for display.
Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her
application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner,
which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached.
Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with much more pleasure,
though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the end of a long concerto, was
glad to purchase praise and gratitude by Scotch and Irish airs, at the request of
her younger sisters, who, with some of the Lucases, and two or three officers,
joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room.
Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing
the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too much engrossed
by his thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas was his neighbour, till Sir
William thus began:
“What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy! There
is nothing like dancing after all. I consider it as one of the first refinements of
polished society.”
“Certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the
less polished societies of the world. Every savage can dance.”
Sir William only smiled. “Your friend performs delightfully,” he continued
after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group; “and I doubt not that you are
an adept in the science yourself, Mr. Darcy.”
“You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir.”
“Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight. Do
you often dance at St. James’s?”
“Never, sir.”
“Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?”
“It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it.”
“You have a house in town, I conclude?”
Mr. Darcy bowed.
“I had once had some thought of fixing in town myself—for I am fond of
superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of London would
agree with Lady Lucas.”
He paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not disposed to
make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was struck
with the action of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to her:
“My dear Miss Eliza, why are you not dancing? Mr. Darcy, you must allow
me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner. You cannot
refuse to dance, I am sure when so much beauty is before you.” And, taking
her hand, he would have given it to Mr. Darcy who, though extremely
surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly drew back, and
said with some discomposure to Sir William:
“Indeed, sir, I have not the least intention of dancing. I entreat you not to
suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner.”
Mr. Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the honour of her
hand, but in vain. Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir William at all shake
her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.
“You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny me the
happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in
general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige us for one half-hour.”
“Mr. Darcy is all politeness,” said Elizabeth, smiling.
“He is, indeed; but, considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza, we
cannot wonder at his complaisance—for who would object to such a partner?”
Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away. Her resistance had not injured
her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some complacency,
when thus accosted by Miss Bingley:
“I can guess the subject of your reverie.”
“I should imagine not.”
“You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings
in this manner—in such society; and indeed I am quite of your opinion. I was
never more annoyed! The insipidity, and yet the noise—the nothingness, and
yet the self-importance of all those people! What would I give to hear your
strictures on them!”
“Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you. My mind was more
agreeably engaged. I have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a
pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow.”
Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he would
tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections. Mr. Darcy
replied with great intrepidity:
“Miss Elizabeth Bennet.”
“Miss Elizabeth Bennet!” repeated Miss Bingley. “I am all astonishment.
How long has she been such a favourite?—and pray, when am I to wish you
joy?”
“That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask. A lady’s
imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love to
matrimony, in a moment. I knew you would be wishing me joy.”
“Nay, if you are serious about it, I shall consider the matter is absolutely
settled. You will be having a charming mother-in-law, indeed; and, of course,
she will always be at Pemberley with you.”
He listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose to entertain
herself in this manner; and as his composure convinced her that all was safe,
her wit flowed long.
Chapter 7
Mr. Bennet’s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two
thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed, in
default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother’s fortune, though
ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply the deficiency of his. Her
father had been an attorney in Meryton, and had left her four thousand pounds.
She had a sister married to a Mr. Phillips, who had been a clerk to their
father and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in London in a
respectable line of trade.
The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most
convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted thither
three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliner’s
shop just over the way. The two youngest of the family, Catherine and Lydia,
were particularly frequent in these attentions; their minds were more vacant
than their sisters’, and when nothing better offered, a walk to Meryton was
necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the
evening; and however bare of news the country in general might be, they
always contrived to learn some from their aunt. At present, indeed, they were
well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia
regiment in the neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and
Meryton was the headquarters.
Their visits to Mrs. Phillips were now productive of the most interesting
intelligence. Every day added something to their knowledge of the officers’
names and connections. Their lodgings were not long a secret, and at length
they began to know the officers themselves. Mr. Phillips visited them all, and
this opened to his nieces a store of felicity unknown before. They could talk of
nothing but officers; and Mr. Bingley’s large fortune, the mention of which
gave animation to their mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to
the regimentals of an ensign.
After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr. Bennet
coolly observed:
“From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two of
the silliest girls in the country. I have suspected it some time, but I am now
convinced.”
Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfect
indifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter, and her
hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the next morning
to London.
“I am astonished, my dear,” said Mrs. Bennet, “that you should be so ready
to think your own children silly. If I wished to think slightingly of anybody’s
children, it should not be of my own, however.”
“If my children are silly, I must hope to be always sensible of it.”
“Yes—but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.”
“This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree. I had
hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I must so far differ
from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish.”
“My dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of
their father and mother. When they get to our age, I dare say they will not
think about officers any more than we do. I remember the time when I liked a
red coat myself very well—and, indeed, so I do still at my heart; and if a smart
young colonel, with five or six thousand a year, should want one of my girls I
shall not say nay to him; and I thought Colonel Forster looked very becoming
the other night at Sir William’s in his regimentals.”
“Mamma,” cried Lydia, “my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain
Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson’s as they did when they first came;
she sees them now very often standing in Clarke’s library.”
Mrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a
note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waited for an
answer. Mrs. Bennet’s eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was eagerly
calling out, while her daughter read,
“Well, Jane, who is it from? What is it about? What does he say? Well,
Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love.”
“It is from Miss Bingley,” said Jane, and then read it aloud.
“MY DEAR FRIEND,—
“If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and me, we
shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives, for a whole
day’s tete-a-tete between two women can never end without a quarrel. Come
as soon as you can on receipt of this. My brother and the gentlemen are to dine
with the officers.—Yours ever,
“CAROLINE BINGLEY”
“With the officers!” cried Lydia. “I wonder my aunt did not tell us of that.”
“Dining out,” said Mrs. Bennet, “that is very unlucky.”
“Can I have the carriage?” said Jane.
“No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to
rain; and then you must stay all night.”
“That would be a good scheme,” said Elizabeth, “if you were sure that they
would not offer to send her home.”
“Oh! but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley’s chaise to go to Meryton,
and the Hursts have no horses to theirs.”
“I had much rather go in the coach.”
“But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure. They are
wanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are they not?”
“They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them.”
“But if you have got them to-day,” said Elizabeth, “my mother’s purpose
will be answered.”
She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses
were engaged. Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her mother
attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day. Her
hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone long before it rained hard. Her
sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was delighted. The rain continued
the whole evening without intermission; Jane certainly could not come back.
“This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!” said Mrs. Bennet more than once,
as if the credit of making it rain were all her own. Till the next morning,
however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance. Breakfast
was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield brought the following note
for Elizabeth:
“MY DEAREST LIZZY,—
“I find myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be imputed
to my getting wet through yesterday. My kind friends will not hear of my
returning till I am better. They insist also on my seeing Mr. Jones—therefore
do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me—and,
excepting a sore throat and headache, there is not much the matter with me.—
Yours, etc.”
“Well, my dear,” said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note aloud,
“if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness—if she should die, it
would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of Mr. Bingley, and under
your orders.”
“Oh! I am not afraid of her dying. People do not die of little trifling colds.
She will be taken good care of. As long as she stays there, it is all very well. I
would go and see her if I could have the carriage.”
Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her, though the
carriage was not to be had; and as she was no horsewoman, walking was her
only alternative. She declared her resolution.
“How can you be so silly,” cried her mother, “as to think of such a thing, in
all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen when you get there.”
“I shall be very fit to see Jane—which is all I want.”
“Is this a hint to me, Lizzy,” said her father, “to send for the horses?”
“No, indeed, I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is nothing when
one has a motive; only three miles. I shall be back by dinner.”
“I admire the activity of your benevolence,” observed Mary, “but every
impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion, exertion
should always be in proportion to what is required.”
“We will go as far as Meryton with you,” said Catherine and Lydia.
Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set off together.
“If we make haste,” said Lydia, as they walked along, “perhaps we may
see something of Captain Carter before he goes.”
In Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of
the officers’ wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing field
after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with
impatient activity, and finding herself at last within view of the house, with
weary ankles, dirty stockings, and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise.
She was shown into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane were
assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise. That she
should have walked three miles so early in the day, in such dirty weather, and
by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and
Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it. She was
received, however, very politely by them; and in their brother’s manners there
was something better than politeness; there was good humour and kindness.
Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr. Hurst nothing at all. The former was
divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her
complexion, and doubt as to the occasion’s justifying her coming so far alone.
The latter was thinking only of his breakfast.
Her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered. Miss
Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and not well enough to
leave her room. Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately; and Jane,
who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience from
expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit, was delighted at
her entrance. She was not equal, however, to much conversation, and when
Miss Bingley left them together, could attempt little besides expressions of
gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with. Elizabeth
silently attended her.
When breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth
began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and solicitude
they showed for Jane. The apothecary came, and having examined his patient,
said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a violent cold, and that they
must endeavour to get the better of it; advised her to return to bed, and
promised her some draughts. The advice was followed readily, for the feverish
symptoms increased, and her head ached acutely. Elizabeth did not quit her
room for a moment; nor were the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen
being out, they had, in fact, nothing to do elsewhere.
When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and very
unwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only
wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern in
parting with her, that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the
chaise to an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present. Elizabeth most
thankfully consented, and a servant was dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint
the family with her stay and bring back a supply of clothes.
Chapter 8
At five o’clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past six Elizabeth
was summoned to dinner. To the civil inquiries which then poured in, and
amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior
solicitude of Mr. Bingley’s, she could not make a very favourable answer. Jane
was by no means better. The sisters, on hearing this, repeated three or four
times how much they were grieved, how shocking it was to have a bad cold,
and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves; and then thought no
more of the matter: and their indifference towards Jane when not immediately
before them restored Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her former dislike.
Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could regard
with any complacency. His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his attentions to
herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feeling herself so much an
intruder as she believed she was considered by the others. She had very little
notice from any but him. Miss Bingley was engrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister
scarcely less so; and as for Mr. Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an
indolent man, who lived only to eat, drink, and play at cards; who, when he
found her to prefer a plain dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.
When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley
began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. Her manners were
pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence; she
had no conversation, no style, no beauty. Mrs. Hurst thought the same, and
added:
“She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent
walker. I shall never forget her appearance this morning. She really looked
almost wild.”
“She did, indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my countenance. Very
nonsensical to come at all! Why must she be scampering about the country,
because her sister had a cold? Her hair, so untidy, so blowsy!”
“Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep in
mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been let down to hide it
not doing its office.”
“Your picture may be very exact, Louisa,” said Bingley; “but this was all
lost upon me. I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well when
she came into the room this morning. Her dirty petticoat quite escaped my
notice.”
“You observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley; “and I am
inclined to think that you would not wish to see your sister make such an
exhibition.”
“Certainly not.”
“To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is, above
her ankles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! What could she mean by it? It seems
to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence, a most countrytown indifference to decorum.”
“It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,” said Bingley.
“I am afraid, Mr. Darcy,” observed Miss Bingley in a half whisper, “that
this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes.”
“Not at all,” he replied; “they were brightened by the exercise.” A short
pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again:
“I have an excessive regard for Miss Jane Bennet, she is really a very
sweet girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well settled. But with such a
father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is no chance of
it.”
“I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in Meryton.”
“Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside.”
“That is capital,” added her sister, and they both laughed heartily.
“If they had uncles enough to fill all Cheapside,” cried Bingley, “it would
not make them one jot less agreeable.”
“But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any
consideration in the world,” replied Darcy.
To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their hearty
assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear
friend’s vulgar relations.
With a renewal of tenderness, however, they returned to her room on
leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee. She was
still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, till late in the evening,
when she had the comfort of seeing her sleep, and when it seemed to her rather
right than pleasant that she should go downstairs herself. On entering the
drawing-room she found the whole party at loo, and was immediately invited
to join them; but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it, and
making her sister the excuse, said she would amuse herself for the short time
she could stay below, with a book. Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment.
“Do you prefer reading to cards?” said he; “that is rather singular.”
“Miss Eliza Bennet,” said Miss Bingley, “despises cards. She is a great
reader, and has no pleasure in anything else.”
“I deserve neither such praise nor such censure,” cried Elizabeth; “I am not
a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things.”
“In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure,” said Bingley; “and I
hope it will be soon increased by seeing her quite well.”
Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards the table
where a few books were lying. He immediately offered to fetch her others—all
that his library afforded.
“And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit;
but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I have more than I ever
looked into.”
Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the
room.
“I am astonished,” said Miss Bingley, “that my father should have left so
small a collection of books. What a delightful library you have at Pemberley,
Mr. Darcy!”
“It ought to be good,” he replied, “it has been the work of many
generations.”
“And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always buying
books.”
“I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as
these.”
“Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that
noble place. Charles, when you build your house, I wish it may be half as
delightful as Pemberley.”
“I wish it may.”
“But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that
neighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model. There is not a finer
county in England than Derbyshire.”
“With all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it.”
“I am talking of possibilities, Charles.”
“Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get Pemberley
by purchase than by imitation.”
Elizabeth was so much caught with what passed, as to leave her very little
attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near the cardtable, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and his eldest sister, to
observe the game.
“Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?” said Miss Bingley; “will
she be as tall as I am?”
“I think she will. She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet’s height, or
rather taller.”
“How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who delighted me
so much. Such a countenance, such manners! And so extremely accomplished
for her age! Her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite.”
“It is amazing to me,” said Bingley, “how young ladies can have patience
to be so very accomplished as they all are.”
“All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you mean?”
“Yes, all of them, I think. They all paint tables, cover screens, and net
purses. I scarcely know anyone who cannot do all this, and I am sure I never
heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without being informed that
she was very accomplished.”
“Your list of the common extent of accomplishments,” said Darcy, “has too
much truth. The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no
otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen. But I am very far from
agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general. I cannot boast of
knowing more than half-a-dozen, in the whole range of my acquaintance, that
are really accomplished.”
“Nor I, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley.
“Then,” observed Elizabeth, “you must comprehend a great deal in your
idea of an accomplished woman.”
“Yes, I do comprehend a great deal in it.”
“Oh! certainly,” cried his faithful assistant, “no one can be really esteemed
accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with. A
woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing, dancing,
and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides all this, she must
possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking, the tone of her
voice, her address and expressions, or the word will be but half-deserved.”
“All this she must possess,” added Darcy, “and to all this she must yet add
something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by extensive
reading.”
“I am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women.
I rather wonder now at your knowing any.”
“Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all
this?”
“I never saw such a woman. I never saw such capacity, and taste, and
application, and elegance, as you describe united.”
Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her
implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who
answered this description, when Mr. Hurst called them to order, with bitter
complaints of their inattention to what was going forward. As all conversation
was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the room.
“Elizabeth Bennet,” said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her,
“is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other
sex by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I dare say, it succeeds.
But, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.”
“Undoubtedly,” replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed,
“there is a meanness in all the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to
employ for captivation. Whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable.”
Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the
subject.
Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and that
she could not leave her. Bingley urged Mr. Jones being sent for immediately;
while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could be of any service,
recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians. This
she would not hear of; but she was not so unwilling to comply with their
brother’s proposal; and it was settled that Mr. Jones should be sent for early in
the morning, if Miss Bennet were not decidedly better. Bingley was quite
uncomfortable; his sisters declared that they were miserable. They solaced
their wretchedness, however, by duets after supper, while he could find no
better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every
attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.
Chapter 9
Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister’s room, and in the
morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the
inquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid, and
some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters. In
spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a note sent to
Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her own judgement of
her situation. The note was immediately dispatched, and its contents as
quickly complied with. Mrs. Bennet, accompanied by her two youngest girls,
reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.
Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would have been
very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not
alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her restoration to
health would probably remove her from Netherfield. She would not listen,
therefore, to her daughter’s proposal of being carried home; neither did the
apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think it at all advisable. After
sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss Bingley’s appearance and invitation,
the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour.
Bingley met them with hopes that Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet
worse than she expected.
“Indeed I have, sir,” was her answer. “She is a great deal too ill to be
moved. Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her. We must trespass a
little longer on your kindness.”
“Removed!” cried Bingley. “It must not be thought of. My sister, I am
sure, will not hear of her removal.”
“You may depend upon it, Madam,” said Miss Bingley, with cold civility,
“that Miss Bennet will receive every possible attention while she remains with
us.”
Mrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.
“I am sure,” she added, “if it was not for such good friends I do not know
what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a vast deal,
though with the greatest patience in the world, which is always the way with
her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest temper I have ever met with. I
often tell my other girls they are nothing to her. You have a sweet room here,
Mr. Bingley, and a charming prospect over the gravel walk. I do not know a
place in the country that is equal to Netherfield. You will not think of quitting
it in a hurry, I hope, though you have but a short lease.”
“Whatever I do is done in a hurry,” replied he; “and therefore if I should
resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five minutes. At
present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here.”
“That is exactly what I should have supposed of you,” said Elizabeth.
“You begin to comprehend me, do you?” cried he, turning towards her.
“Oh! yes—I understand you perfectly.”
“I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen through
I am afraid is pitiful.”
“That is as it happens. It does not follow that a deep, intricate character is
more or less estimable than such a one as yours.”
“Lizzy,” cried her mother, “remember where you are, and do not run on in
the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.”
“I did not know before,” continued Bingley immediately, “that you were a
studier of character. It must be an amusing study.”
“Yes, but intricate characters are the most amusing. They have at least that
advantage.”
“The country,” said Darcy, “can in general supply but a few subjects for
such a study. In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and
unvarying society.”
“But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be
observed in them for ever.”
“Yes, indeed,” cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a
country neighbourhood. “I assure you there is quite as much of that going on
in the country as in town.”
Everybody was surprised, and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment,
turned silently away. Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete
victory over him, continued her triumph.
“I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country, for my
part, except the shops and public places. The country is a vast deal pleasanter,
is it not, Mr. Bingley?”
“When I am in the country,” he replied, “I never wish to leave it; and when
I am in town it is pretty much the same. They have each their advantages, and
I can be equally happy in either.”
“Aye—that is because you have the right disposition. But that gentleman,”
looking at Darcy, “seemed to think the country was nothing at all.”
“Indeed, Mamma, you are mistaken,” said Elizabeth, blushing for her
mother. “You quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He only meant that there was not such
a variety of people to be met with in the country as in the town, which you
must acknowledge to be true.”
“Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with
many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few neighbourhoods
larger. I know we dine with four-and-twenty families.”
Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his
countenance. His sister was less delicate, and directed her eyes towards Mr.
Darcy with a very expressive smile. Elizabeth, for the sake of saying
something that might turn her mother’s thoughts, now asked her if Charlotte
Lucas had been at Longbourn since her coming away.
“Yes, she called yesterday with her father. What an agreeable man Sir
William is, Mr. Bingley, is not he? So much the man of fashion! So genteel
and easy! He has always something to say to everybody. That is my idea of
good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very important, and
never open their mouths, quite mistake the matter.”
“Did Charlotte dine with you?”
“No, she would go home. I fancy she was wanted about the mince-pies.
For my part, Mr. Bingley, I always keep servants that can do their own work;
my daughters are brought up very differently. But everybody is to judge for
themselves, and the Lucases are a very good sort of girls, I assure you. It is a
pity they are not handsome! Not that I think Charlotte so very plain—but then
she is our particular friend.”
“She seems a very pleasant young woman.”
“Oh! dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain. Lady Lucas herself has
often said so, and envied me Jane’s beauty. I do not like to boast of my own
child, but to be sure, Jane—one does not often see anybody better looking. It
is what everybody says. I do not trust my own partiality. When she was only
fifteen, there was a man at my brother Gardiner’s in town so much in love
with her that my sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we
came away. But, however, he did not. Perhaps he thought her too young.
However, he wrote some verses on her, and very pretty they were.”
“And so ended his affection,” said Elizabeth impatiently. “There has been
many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way. I wonder who first discovered
the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!”
“I have been used to consider poetry as the food of love,” said Darcy.
“Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may. Everything nourishes what is strong
already. But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I am convinced that
one good sonnet will starve it entirely away.”
Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth
tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again. She longed to speak,
but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs. Bennet began
repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to Jane, with an apology
for troubling him also with Lizzy. Mr. Bingley was unaffectedly civil in his
answer, and forced his younger sister to be civil also, and say what the
occasion required. She performed her part indeed without much graciousness,
but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, and soon afterwards ordered her carriage. Upon
this signal, the youngest of her daughters put herself forward. The two girls
had been whispering to each other during the whole visit, and the result of it
was, that the youngest should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his
first coming into the country to give a ball at Netherfield.
Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion and
good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose affection had
brought her into public at an early age. She had high animal spirits, and a sort
of natural self-consequence, which the attention of the officers, to whom her
uncle’s good dinners, and her own easy manners recommended her, had
increased into assurance. She was very equal, therefore, to address Mr.
Bingley on the subject of the ball, and abruptly reminded him of his promise;
adding, that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not
keep it. His answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother’s ear:
“I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and when
your sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the very day of the ball.
But you would not wish to be dancing when she is ill.”
Lydia declared herself satisfied. “Oh! yes—it would be much better to wait
till Jane was well, and by that time most likely Captain Carter would be at
Meryton again. And when you have given your ball,” she added, “I shall insist
on their giving one also. I shall tell Colonel Forster it will be quite a shame if
he does not.”
Mrs. Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returned
instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations’ behaviour to the remarks
of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the latter of whom, however, could not be
prevailed on to join in their censure of her, in spite of all Miss Bingley’s
witticisms on fine eyes.
Chapter 10
The day passed much as the day before had done. Mrs. Hurst and Miss
Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who continued,
though slowly, to mend; and in the evening Elizabeth joined their party in the
drawing-room. The loo-table, however, did not appear. Mr. Darcy was writing,
and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching the progress of his letter and
repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister. Mr. Hurst and Mr.
Bingley were at piquet, and Mrs. Hurst was observing their game.
Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in
attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion. The perpetual
commendations of the lady, either on his handwriting, or on the evenness of
his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern with which
her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was exactly in union
with her opinion of each.
“How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!”
He made no answer.
“You write uncommonly fast.”
“You are mistaken. I write rather slowly.”
“How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a year!
Letters of business, too! How odious I should think them!”
“It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of yours.”
“Pray tell your sister that I long to see her.”
“I have already told her so once, by your desire.”
“I am afraid you do not like your pen. Let me mend it for you. I mend pens
remarkably well.”
“Thank you—but I always mend my own.”
“How can you contrive to write so even?”
He was silent.
“Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp;
and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design
for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to Miss Grantley’s.”
“Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again? At present
I have not room to do them justice.”
“Oh! it is of no consequence. I shall see her in January. But do you always
write such charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?”
“They are generally long; but whether always charming it is not for me to
determine.”
“It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter with ease,
cannot write ill.”
“That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline,” cried her brother,
“because he does not write with ease. He studies too much for words of four
syllables. Do not you, Darcy?”
“My style of writing is very different from yours.”
“Oh!” cried Miss Bingley, “Charles writes in the most careless way
imaginable. He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest.”
“My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them—by which
means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents.”
“Your humility, Mr. Bingley,” said Elizabeth, “must disarm reproof.”
“Nothing is more deceitful,” said Darcy, “than the appearance of humility.
It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an indirect boast.”
“And which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty?”
“The indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects in writing,
because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and
carelessness of execution, which, if not estimable, you think at least highly
interesting. The power of doing anything with quickness is always prized
much by the possessor, and often without any attention to the imperfection of
the performance. When you told Mrs. Bennet this morning that if you ever
resolved upon quitting Netherfield you should be gone in five minutes, you
meant it to be a sort of panegyric, of compliment to yourself—and yet what is
there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary
business undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else?”
“Nay,” cried Bingley, “this is too much, to remember at night all the
foolish things that were said in the morning. And yet, upon my honour, I
believe what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this moment. At
least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely
to show off before the ladies.”
“I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that you
would be gone with such celerity. Your conduct would be quite as dependent
on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were mounting your horse,
a friend were to say, ‘Bingley, you had better stay till next week,’ you would
probably do it, you would probably not go—and at another word, might stay a
month.”
“You have only proved by this,” cried Elizabeth, “that Mr. Bingley did not
do justice to his own disposition. You have shown him off now much more
than he did himself.”
“I am exceedingly gratified,” said Bingley, “by your converting what my
friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper. But I am afraid
you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend; for he
would certainly think better of me, if under such a circumstance I were to give
a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I could.”
“Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intentions as
atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?”
“Upon my word, I cannot exactly explain the matter; Darcy must speak for
himself.”
“You expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine, but
which I have never acknowledged. Allowing the case, however, to stand
according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet, that the
friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and the delay of his
plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering one argument in favour of
its propriety.”
“To yield readily—easily—to the persuasion of a friend is no merit with
you.”
“To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of
either.”
“You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of
friendship and affection. A regard for the requester would often make one
readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason one into it. I
am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about Mr.
Bingley. We may as well wait, perhaps, till the circumstance occurs before we
discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon. But in general and ordinary
cases between friend and friend, where one of them is desired by the other to
change a resolution of no very great moment, should you think ill of that
person for complying with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?”
“Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange
with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to
this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties?”
“By all means,” cried Bingley; “let us hear all the particulars, not
forgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have more weight in
the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of. I assure you, that if
Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with myself, I should
not pay him half so much deference. I declare I do not know a more awful
object than Darcy, on particular occasions, and in particular places; at his own
house especially, and of a Sunday evening, when he has nothing to do.”
Mr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was
rather offended, and therefore checked her laugh. Miss Bingley warmly
resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her brother for
talking such nonsense.
“I see your design, Bingley,” said his friend. “You dislike an argument, and
want to silence this.”
“Perhaps I do. Arguments are too much like disputes. If you and Miss
Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very thankful; and
then you may say whatever you like of me.”
“What you ask,” said Elizabeth, “is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr. Darcy
had much better finish his letter.”
Mr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.
When that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth for
an indulgence of some music. Miss Bingley moved with some alacrity to the
pianoforte; and, after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead the way which
the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she seated herself.
Mrs. Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus employed,
Elizabeth could not help observing, as she turned over some music-books that
lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr. Darcy’s eyes were fixed on her. She
hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so
great a man; and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her, was
still more strange. She could only imagine, however, at last that she drew his
notice because there was something more wrong and reprehensible, according
to his ideas of right, than in any other person present. The supposition did not
pain her. She liked him too little to care for his approbation.
After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by a
lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing near Elizabeth, said
to her:
“Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an
opportunity of dancing a reel?”
She smiled, but made no answer. He repeated the question, with some
surprise at her silence.
“Oh!” said she, “I heard you before, but I could not immediately determine
what to say in reply. You wanted me, I know, to say ‘Yes,’ that you might have
the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always delight in overthrowing those
kind of schemes, and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt. I have,
therefore, made up my mind to tell you, that I do not want to dance a reel at all
—and now despise me if you dare.”
“Indeed I do not dare.”
Elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his
gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner
which made it difficult for her to affront anybody; and Darcy had never been
so bewitched by any woman as he was by her. He really believed, that were it
not for the inferiority of her connections, he should be in some danger.
Miss Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her great anxiety
for the recovery of her dear friend Jane received some assistance from her
desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.
She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of
their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance.
“I hope,” said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next
day, “you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this desirable event
takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue; and if you can compass
it, do cure the younger girls of running after officers. And, if I may mention so
delicate a subject, endeavour to check that little something, bordering on
conceit and impertinence, which your lady possesses.”
“Have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?”
“Oh! yes. Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Phillips be placed in
the gallery at Pemberley. Put them next to your great-uncle the judge. They are
in the same profession, you know, only in different lines. As for your
Elizabeth’s picture, you must not have it taken, for what painter could do
justice to those beautiful eyes?”
“It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but their colour
and shape, and the eyelashes, so remarkably fine, might be copied.”
At that moment they were met from another walk by Mrs. Hurst and
Elizabeth herself.
“I did not know that you intended to walk,” said Miss Bingley, in some
confusion, lest they had been overheard.
“You used us abominably ill,” answered Mrs. Hurst, “running away
without telling us that you were coming out.”
Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left Elizabeth to walk by
herself. The path just admitted three. Mr. Darcy felt their rudeness, and
immediately said:
“This walk is not wide enough for our party. We had better go into the
avenue.”
But Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them,
laughingly answered:
“No, no; stay where you are. You are charmingly grouped, and appear to
uncommon advantage. The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth.
Good-bye.”
She then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of being
at home again in a day or two. Jane was already so much recovered as to
intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening.
Chapter 11
When the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to her sister, and
seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the drawing-room, where
she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure; and
Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour
which passed before the gentlemen appeared. Their powers of conversation
were considerable. They could describe an entertainment with accuracy, relate
an anecdote with humour, and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit.
But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object; Miss
Bingley’s eyes were instantly turned toward Darcy, and she had something to
say to him before he had advanced many steps. He addressed himself to Miss
Bennet, with a polite congratulation; Mr. Hurst also made her a slight bow, and
said he was “very glad;” but diffuseness and warmth remained for Bingley’s
salutation. He was full of joy and attention. The first half-hour was spent in
piling up the fire, lest she should suffer from the change of room; and she
removed at his desire to the other side of the fireplace, that she might be
further from the door. He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to anyone
else. Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great delight.
When tea was over, Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the card-table
—but in vain. She had obtained private intelligence that Mr. Darcy did not
wish for cards; and Mr. Hurst soon found even his open petition rejected. She
assured him that no one intended to play, and the silence of the whole party on
the subject seemed to justify her. Mr. Hurst had therefore nothing to do, but to
stretch himself on one of the sofas and go to sleep. Darcy took up a book;
Miss Bingley did the same; and Mrs. Hurst, principally occupied in playing
with her bracelets and rings, joined now and then in her brother’s conversation
with Miss Bennet.
Miss Bingley’s attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr.
Darcy’s progress through his book, as in reading her own; and she was
perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page. She could not
win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her question, and
read on. At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own
book, which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his, she
gave a great yawn and said, “How pleasant it is to spend an evening in this
way! I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading! How much sooner
one tires of anything than of a book! When I have a house of my own, I shall
be miserable if I have not an excellent library.”
No one made any reply. She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and
cast her eyes round the room in quest for some amusement; when hearing her
brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly towards him
and said:
“By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at
Netherfield? I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult the
wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are not some among
us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure.”
“If you mean Darcy,” cried her brother, “he may go to bed, if he chooses,
before it begins—but as for the ball, it is quite a settled thing; and as soon as
Nicholls has made white soup enough, I shall send round my cards.”
“I should like balls infinitely better,” she replied, “if they were carried on
in a different manner; but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual
process of such a meeting. It would surely be much more rational if
conversation instead of dancing were made the order of the day.”
“Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would not be near
so much like a ball.”
Miss Bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards she got up and walked
about the room. Her figure was elegant, and she walked well; but Darcy, at
whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious. In the desperation of her
feelings, she resolved on one effort more, and, turning to Elizabeth, said:
“Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a
turn about the room. I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in
one attitude.”
Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. Miss Bingley
succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr. Darcy looked up. He
was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as Elizabeth
herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book. He was directly invited to
join their party, but he declined it, observing that he could imagine but two
motives for their choosing to walk up and down the room together, with either
of which motives his joining them would interfere. “What could he mean? She
was dying to know what could be his meaning?”—and asked Elizabeth
whether she could at all understand him?
“Not at all,” was her answer; “but depend upon it, he means to be severe
on us, and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing about
it.”
Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy in
anything, and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two
motives.
“I have not the smallest objection to explaining them,” said he, as soon as
she allowed him to speak. “You either choose this method of passing the
evening because you are in each other’s confidence, and have secret affairs to
discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest
advantage in walking; if the first, I would be completely in your way, and if
the second, I can admire you much better as I sit by the fire.”
“Oh! shocking!” cried Miss Bingley. “I never heard anything so
abominable. How shall we punish him for such a speech?”
“Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination,” said Elizabeth. “We can
all plague and punish one another. Tease him—laugh at him. Intimate as you
are, you must know how it is to be done.”
“But upon my honour, I do not. I do assure you that my intimacy has not
yet taught me that. Tease calmness of manner and presence of mind! No, no; I
feel he may defy us there. And as to laughter, we will not expose ourselves, if
you please, by attempting to laugh without a subject. Mr. Darcy may hug
himself.”
“Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!” cried Elizabeth. “That is an
uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it would be
a great loss to me to have many such acquaintances. I dearly love a laugh.”
“Miss Bingley,” said he, “has given me more credit than can be. The wisest
and the best of men—nay, the wisest and best of their actions—may be
rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke.”
“Certainly,” replied Elizabeth—“there are such people, but I hope I am not
one of them. I hope I never ridicule what is wise and good. Follies and
nonsense, whims and inconsistencies, do divert me, I own, and I laugh at them
whenever I can. But these, I suppose, are precisely what you are without.”
“Perhaps that is not possible for anyone. But it has been the study of my
life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to
ridicule.”
“Such as vanity and pride.”
“Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed. But pride—where there is a real
superiority of mind, pride will be always under good regulation.”
Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile.
“Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume,” said Miss Bingley;
“and pray what is the result?”
“I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect. He owns it
himself without disguise.”
“No,” said Darcy, “I have made no such pretension. I have faults enough,
but they are not, I hope, of understanding. My temper I dare not vouch for. It
is, I believe, too little yielding—certainly too little for the convenience of the
world. I cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as I ought, nor
their offenses against myself. My feelings are not puffed about with every
attempt to move them. My temper would perhaps be called resentful. My good
opinion once lost, is lost forever.”
“That is a failing indeed!” cried Elizabeth. “Implacable resentment is a
shade in a character. But you have chosen your fault well. I really cannot laugh
at it. You are safe from me.”
“There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil
—a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome.”
“And your defect is to hate everybody.”
“And yours,” he replied with a smile, “is willfully to misunderstand them.”
“Do let us have a little music,” cried Miss Bingley, tired of a conversation
in which she had no share. “Louisa, you will not mind my waking Mr. Hurst?”
Her sister had not the smallest objection, and the pianoforte was opened;
and Darcy, after a few moments’ recollection, was not sorry for it. He began to
feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention.
Chapter 12
In consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth wrote the
next morning to their mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in
the course of the day. But Mrs. Bennet, who had calculated on her daughters
remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday, which would exactly
finish Jane’s week, could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure
before. Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at least not to Elizabeth’s
wishes, for she was impatient to get home. Mrs. Bennet sent them word that
they could not possibly have the carriage before Tuesday; and in her postscript
it was added, that if Mr. Bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she
could spare them very well. Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth was
positively resolved—nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful,
on the contrary, as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long,
she urged Jane to borrow Mr. Bingley’s carriage immediately, and at length it
was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield that morning
should be mentioned, and the request made.
The communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was
said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on Jane; and
till the morrow their going was deferred. Miss Bingley was then sorry that she
had proposed the delay, for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much
exceeded her affection for the other.
The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so
soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be safe
for her—that she was not enough recovered; but Jane was firm where she felt
herself to be right.
To Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligence—Elizabeth had been at
Netherfield long enough. She attracted him more than he liked—and Miss
Bingley was uncivil to her, and more teasing than usual to himself. He wisely
resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should now
escape him, nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his
felicity; sensible that if such an idea had been suggested, his behaviour during
the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it. Steady to
his purpose, he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of Saturday,
and though they were at one time left by themselves for half-an-hour, he
adhered most conscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her.
On Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost
all, took place. Miss Bingley’s civility to Elizabeth increased at last very
rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane; and when they parted, after assuring
the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at
Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most tenderly, she even shook
hands with the former. Elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest
of spirits.
They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother. Mrs.
Bennet wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so
much trouble, and was sure Jane would have caught cold again. But their
father, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really glad to
see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle. The evening
conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of its animation,
and almost all its sense by the absence of Jane and Elizabeth.
They found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough-bass and human
nature; and had some extracts to admire, and some new observations of
threadbare morality to listen to. Catherine and Lydia had information for them
of a different sort. Much had been done and much had been said in the
regiment since the preceding Wednesday; several of the officers had dined
lately with their uncle, a private had been flogged, and it had actually been
hinted that Colonel Forster was going to be married.
Chapter 13
“I hope, my dear,” said Mr. Bennet to his wife, as they were at breakfast
the next morning, “that you have ordered a good dinner to-day, because I have
reason to expect an addition to our family party.”
“Who do you mean, my dear? I know of nobody that is coming, I am sure,
unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in—and I hope my dinners are
good enough for her. I do not believe she often sees such at home.”
“The person of whom I speak is a gentleman, and a stranger.”
Mrs. Bennet’s eyes sparkled. “A gentleman and a stranger! It is Mr.
Bingley, I am sure! Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr.
Bingley. But—good Lord! how unlucky! There is not a bit of fish to be got today. Lydia, my love, ring the bell—I must speak to Hill this moment.”
“It is not Mr. Bingley,” said her husband; “it is a person whom I never saw
in the whole course of my life.”
This roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being
eagerly questioned by his wife and his five daughters at once.
After amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus explained:
“About a month ago I received this letter; and about a fortnight ago I
answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and requiring early
attention. It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins, who, when I am dead, may turn
you all out of this house as soon as he pleases.”
“Oh! my dear,” cried his wife, “I cannot bear to hear that mentioned. Pray
do not talk of that odious man. I do think it is the hardest thing in the world,
that your estate should be entailed away from your own children; and I am
sure, if I had been you, I should have tried long ago to do something or other
about it.”
Jane and Elizabeth tried to explain to her the nature of an entail. They had
often attempted to do it before, but it was a subject on which Mrs. Bennet was
beyond the reach of reason, and she continued to rail bitterly against the
cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters, in favour of
a man whom nobody cared anything about.
“It certainly is a most iniquitous affair,” said Mr. Bennet, “and nothing can
clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn. But if you will listen
to his letter, you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing
himself.”
“No, that I am sure I shall not; and I think it is very impertinent of him to
write to you at all, and very hypocritical. I hate such false friends. Why could
he not keep on quarreling with you, as his father did before him?”
“Why, indeed; he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head,
as you will hear.”
“Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent, 15th October.
“Dear Sir,—
“The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured
father always gave me much uneasiness, and since I have had the misfortune
to lose him, I have frequently wished to heal the breach; but for some time I
was kept back by my own doubts, fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to
his memory for me to be on good terms with anyone with whom it had always
pleased him to be at variance.—‘There, Mrs. Bennet.’—My mind, however, is
now made up on the subject, for having received ordination at Easter, I have
been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the Right
Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh, widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh, whose
bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish,
where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect
towards her ladyship, and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies
which are instituted by the Church of England. As a clergyman, moreover, I
feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families
within the reach of my influence; and on these grounds I flatter myself that my
present overtures are highly commendable, and that the circumstance of my
being next in the entail of Longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your
side, and not lead you to reject the offered olive-branch. I cannot be otherwise
than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters, and beg
leave to apologise for it, as well as to assure you of my readiness to make
them every possible amends—but of this hereafter. If you should have no
objection to receive me into your house, I propose myself the satisfaction of
waiting on you and your family, Monday, November 18th, by four o’clock,
and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday se’ennight
following, which I can do without any inconvenience, as Lady Catherine is far
from objecting to my occasional absence on a Sunday, provided that some
other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day.—I remain, dear sir, with
respectful compliments to your lady and daughters, your well-wisher and
friend,
“WILLIAM COLLINS”
“At four o’clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making gentleman,”
said Mr. Bennet, as he folded up the letter. “He seems to be a most
conscientious and polite young man, upon my word, and I doubt not will
prove a valuable acquaintance, especially if Lady Catherine should be so
indulgent as to let him come to us again.”
“There is some sense in what he says about the girls, however, and if he is
disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the person to discourage
him.”
“Though it is difficult,” said Jane, “to guess in what way he can mean to
make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his credit.”
Elizabeth was chiefly struck by his extraordinary deference for Lady
Catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and burying his
parishioners whenever it were required.
“He must be an oddity, I think,” said she. “I cannot make him out.—There
is something very pompous in his style.—And what can he mean by
apologising for being next in the entail?—We cannot suppose he would help it
if he could.—Could he be a sensible man, sir?”
“No, my dear, I think not. I have great hopes of finding him quite the
reverse. There is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his letter, which
promises well. I am impatient to see him.”
“In point of composition,” said Mary, “the letter does not seem defective.
The idea of the olive-branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet I think it is well
expressed.”
To Catherine and Lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree
interesting. It was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet
coat, and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the
society of a man in any other colour. As for their mother, Mr. Collins’s letter
had done away much of her ill-will, and she was preparing to see him with a
degree of composure which astonished her husband and daughters.
Mr. Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great
politeness by the whole family. Mr. Bennet indeed said little; but the ladies
were ready enough to talk, and Mr. Collins seemed neither in need of
encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself. He was a tall, heavy-looking
young man of five-and-twenty. His air was grave and stately, and his manners
were very formal. He had not been long seated before he complimented Mrs.
Bennet on having so fine a family of daughters; said he had heard much of
their beauty, but that in this instance fame had fallen short of the truth; and
added, that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time disposed of in
marriage. This gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers; but
Mrs. Bennet, who quarreled with no compliments, answered most readily.
“You are very kind, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it may prove
so, for else they will be destitute enough. Things are settled so oddly.”
“You allude, perhaps, to the entail of this estate.”
“Ah! sir, I do indeed. It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you must
confess. Not that I mean to find fault with you, for such things I know are all
chance in this world. There is no knowing how estates will go when once they
come to be entailed.”
“I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins, and could
say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of appearing forward and
precipitate. But I can assure the young ladies that I come prepared to admire
them. At present I will not say more; but, perhaps, when we are better
acquainted—”
He was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each
other. They were not the only objects of Mr. Collins’s admiration. The hall, the
dining-room, and all its furniture, were examined and praised; and his
commendation of everything would have touched Mrs. Bennet’s heart, but for
the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property. The
dinner too in its turn was highly admired; and he begged to know to which of
his fair cousins the excellency of its cooking was owing. But he was set right
there by Mrs. Bennet, who assured him with some asperity that they were very
well able to keep a good cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the
kitchen. He begged pardon for having displeased her. In a softened tone she
declared herself not at all offended; but he continued to apologise for about a
quarter of an hour.
Chapter 14
During dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants
were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest,
and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine, by observing
that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness. Lady Catherine de Bourgh’s
attention to his wishes, and consideration for his comfort, appeared very
remarkable. Mr. Bennet could not have chosen better. Mr. Collins was
eloquent in her praise. The subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity
of manner, and with a most important aspect he protested that “he had never in
his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank—such affability and
condescension, as he had himself experienced from Lady Catherine. She had
been graciously pleased to approve of both of the discourses which he had
already had the honour of preaching before her. She had also asked him twice
to dine at Rosings, and had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up
her pool of quadrille in the evening. Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by
many people he knew, but he had never seen anything but affability in her. She
had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she made not
the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood nor to
his leaving the parish occasionally for a week or two, to visit his relations. She
had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could, provided
he chose with discretion; and had once paid him a visit in his humble
parsonage, where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been
making, and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself—some shelves in
the closet up stairs.”
“That is all very proper and civil, I am sure,” said Mrs. Bennet, “and I dare
say she is a very agreeable woman. It is a pity that great ladies in general are
not more like her. Does she live near you, sir?”
“The garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane
from Rosings Park, her ladyship’s residence.”
“I think you said she was a widow, sir? Has she any family?”
“She has only one daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very extensive
property.”
“Ah!” said Mrs. Bennet, shaking her head, “then she is better off than
many girls. And what sort of young lady is she? Is she handsome?”
“She is a most charming young lady indeed. Lady Catherine herself says
that, in point of true beauty, Miss de Bourgh is far superior to the handsomest
of her sex, because there is that in her features which marks the young lady of
distinguished birth. She is unfortunately of a sickly constitution, which has
prevented her from making that progress in many accomplishments which she
could not have otherwise failed of, as I am informed by the lady who
superintended her education, and who still resides with them. But she is
perfectly amiable, and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her
little phaeton and ponies.”
“Has she been presented? I do not remember her name among the ladies at
court.”
“Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town; and
by that means, as I told Lady Catherine one day, has deprived the British court
of its brightest ornament. Her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea; and you
may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate
compliments which are always acceptable to ladies. I have more than once
observed to Lady Catherine, that her charming daughter seemed born to be a
duchess, and that the most elevated rank, instead of giving her consequence,
would be adorned by her. These are the kind of little things which please her
ladyship, and it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound
to pay.”
“You judge very properly,” said Mr. Bennet, “and it is happy for you that
you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy. May I ask whether these
pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment, or are the result
of previous study?”
“They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though I
sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant
compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, I always wish to give
them as unstudied an air as possible.”
Mr. Bennet’s expectations were fully answered. His cousin was as absurd
as he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment,
maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance,
and, except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner in his
pleasure.
By tea-time, however, the dose had been enough, and Mr. Bennet was glad
to take his guest into the drawing-room again, and, when tea was over, glad to
invite him to read aloud to the ladies. Mr. Collins readily assented, and a book
was produced; but, on beholding it (for everything announced it to be from a
circulating library), he started back, and begging pardon, protested that he
never read novels. Kitty stared at him, and Lydia exclaimed. Other books were
produced, and after some deliberation he chose Fordyce’s Sermons. Lydia
gaped as he opened the volume, and before he had, with very monotonous
solemnity, read three pages, she interrupted him with:
“Do you know, mamma, that my uncle Phillips talks of turning away
Richard; and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him. My aunt told me so
herself on Saturday. I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow to hear more about it,
and to ask when Mr. Denny comes back from town.”
Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but Mr. Collins,
much offended, laid aside his book, and said:
“I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a
serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit. It amazes me, I confess;
for, certainly, there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction. But
I will no longer importune my young cousin.”
Then turning to Mr. Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at
backgammon. Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted very
wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements. Mrs. Bennet and
her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia’s interruption, and promised
that it should not occur again, if he would resume his book; but Mr. Collins,
after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill-will, and should never
resent her behaviour as any affront, seated himself at another table with Mr.
Bennet, and prepared for backgammon.
Chapter 15
Mr. Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had been
but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part of his life having
been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father; and though
he belonged to one of the universities, he had merely kept the necessary terms,
without forming at it any useful acquaintance. The subjection in which his
father had brought him up had given him originally great humility of manner;
but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head,
living in retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected
prosperity. A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de
Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he felt
for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness, mingling with a
very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a clergyman, and his right as
a rector, made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness, selfimportance and humility.
Having now a good house and a very sufficient income, he intended to
marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had a
wife in view, as he meant to choose one of the daughters, if he found them as
handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report. This was
his plan of amends—of atonement—for inheriting their father’s estate; and he
thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and suitableness, and excessively
generous and disinterested on his own part.
His plan did not vary on seeing them. Miss Bennet’s lovely face confirmed
his views, and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority;
and for the first evening she was his settled choice. The next morning,
however, made an alteration; for in a quarter of an hour’s tete-a-tete with Mrs.
Bennet before breakfast, a conversation beginning with his parsonage-house,
and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress might be
found for it at Longbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles
and general encouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on.
“As to her younger daughters, she could not take upon her to say—she could
not positively answer—but she did not know of any prepossession; her eldest
daughter, she must just mention—she felt it incumbent on her to hint, was
likely to be very soon engaged.”
Mr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth—and it was soon
done—done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire. Elizabeth, equally next to
Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.
Mrs. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have
two daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the
day before was now high in her good graces.
Lydia’s intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten; every sister
except Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr. Collins was to attend them, at the
request of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him, and have his
library to himself; for thither Mr. Collins had followed him after breakfast; and
there he would continue, nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in
the collection, but really talking to Mr. Bennet, with little cessation, of his
house and garden at Hunsford. Such doings discomposed Mr. Bennet
exceedingly. In his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity;
and though prepared, as he told Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in
every other room of the house, he was used to be free from them there; his
civility, therefore, was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his
daughters in their walk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a
walker than a reader, was extremely pleased to close his large book, and go.
In pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his cousins,
their time passed till they entered Meryton. The attention of the younger ones
was then no longer to be gained by him. Their eyes were immediately
wandering up in the street in quest of the officers, and nothing less than a very
smart bonnet indeed, or a really new muslin in a shop window, could recall
them.
But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom
they had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike appearance, walking with
another officer on the other side of the way. The officer was the very Mr.
Denny concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire, and he
bowed as they passed. All were struck with the stranger’s air, all wondered
who he could be; and Kitty and Lydia, determined if possible to find out, led
the way across the street, under pretense of wanting something in an opposite
shop, and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen,
turning back, had reached the same spot. Mr. Denny addressed them directly,
and entreated permission to introduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had
returned with him the day before from town, and he was happy to say had
accepted a commission in their corps. This was exactly as it should be; for the
young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming. His
appearance was greatly in his favour; he had all the best part of beauty, a fine
countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address. The introduction was
followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation—a readiness at
the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the whole party were still
standing and talking together very agreeably, when the sound of horses drew
their notice, and Darcy and Bingley were seen riding down the street. On
distinguishing the ladies of the group, the two gentlemen came directly
towards them, and began the usual civilities. Bingley was the principal
spokesman, and Miss Bennet the principal object. He was then, he said, on his
way to Longbourn on purpose to inquire after her. Mr. Darcy corroborated it
with a bow, and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth,
when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger, and Elizabeth
happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other, was all
astonishment at the effect of the meeting. Both changed colour, one looked
white, the other red. Mr. Wickham, after a few moments, touched his hat—a
salutation which Mr. Darcy just deigned to return. What could be the meaning
of it? It was impossible to imagine; it was impossible not to long to know.
In another minute, Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what
passed, took leave and rode on with his friend.
Mr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of
Mr. Phillip’s house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydia’s
pressing entreaties that they should come in, and even in spite of Mrs.
Phillips’s throwing up the parlour window and loudly seconding the invitation.
Mrs. Phillips was always glad to see her nieces; and the two eldest, from
their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and she was eagerly
expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as their own
carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing about, if she
had not happened to see Mr. Jones’s shop-boy in the street, who had told her
that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield because the Miss
Bennets were come away, when her civility was claimed towards Mr. Collins
by Jane’s introduction of him. She received him with her very best politeness,
which he returned with as much more, apologising for his intrusion, without
any previous acquaintance with her, which he could not help flattering
himself, however, might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies
who introduced him to her notice. Mrs. Phillips was quite awed by such an
excess of good breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put
to an end by exclamations and inquiries about the other; of whom, however,
she could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that Mr. Denny had
brought him from London, and that he was to have a lieutenant’s commission
in the ——shire. She had been watching him the last hour, she said, as he
walked up and down the street, and had Mr. Wickham appeared, Kitty and
Lydia would certainly have continued the occupation, but unluckily no one
passed windows now except a few of the officers, who, in comparison with the
stranger, were become “stupid, disagreeable fellows.” Some of them were to
dine with the Phillipses the next day, and their aunt promised to make her
husband call on Mr. Wickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family
from Longbourn would come in the evening. This was agreed to, and Mrs.
Phillips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of
lottery tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards. The prospect of such
delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits. Mr. Collins
repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured with unwearying
civility that they were perfectly needless.
As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass
between the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended either or
both, had they appeared to be in the wrong, she could no more explain such
behaviour than her sister.
Mr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by admiring Mrs.
Phillips’s manners and politeness. He protested that, except Lady Catherine
and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman; for she had not
only received him with the utmost civility, but even pointedly included him in
her invitation for the next evening, although utterly unknown to her before.
Something, he supposed, might be attributed to his connection with them, but
yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life.
Chapter 16
As no objection was made to the young people’s engagement with their
aunt, and all Mr. Collins’s scruples of leaving Mr. and Mrs. Bennet for a single
evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach conveyed him
and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and the girls had the
pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room, that Mr. Wickham had
accepted their uncle’s invitation, and was then in the house.
When this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr.
Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much
struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he might
almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at
Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification; but
when Mrs. Phillips understood from him what Rosings was, and who was its
proprietor—when she had listened to the description of only one of Lady
Catherine’s drawing-rooms, and found that the chimney-piece alone had cost
eight hundred pounds, she felt all the force of the compliment, and would
hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper’s room.
In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion,
with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and the
improvements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the gentlemen
joined them; and he found in Mrs. Phillips a very attentive listener, whose
opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard, and who was
resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could. To the
girls, who could not listen to their cousin, and who had nothing to do but to
wish for an instrument, and examine their own indifferent imitations of china
on the mantelpiece, the interval of waiting appeared very long. It was over at
last, however. The gentlemen did approach, and when Mr. Wickham walked
into the room, Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor
thinking of him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration.
The officers of the ——shire were in general a very creditable, gentlemanlike
set, and the best of them were of the present party; but Mr. Wickham was as
far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and walk, as they were
superior to the broad-faced, stuffy uncle Phillips, breathing port wine, who
followed them into the room.
Mr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye
was turned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated
himself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into
conversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, made her feel that
the commonest, dullest, most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting
by the skill of the speaker.
With such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickham and the officers,
Mr. Collins seemed to sink into insignificance; to the young ladies he certainly
was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kind listener in Mrs. Phillips, and
was by her watchfulness, most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin.
When the card-tables were placed, he had the opportunity of obliging her in
turn, by sitting down to whist.
“I know little of the game at present,” said he, “but I shall be glad to
improve myself, for in my situation in life—” Mrs. Phillips was very glad for
his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.
Mr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he received
at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia. At first there seemed danger of
Lydia’s engrossing him entirely, for she was a most determined talker; but
being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets, she soon grew too much
interested in the game, too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes to
have attention for anyone in particular. Allowing for the common demands of
the game, Mr. Wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she
was very willing to hear him, though what she chiefly wished to hear she
could not hope to be told—the history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy. She
dared not even mention that gentleman. Her curiosity, however, was
unexpectedly relieved. Mr. Wickham began the subject himself. He inquired
how far Netherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked
in a hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy had been staying there.
“About a month,” said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject
drop, added, “He is a man of very large property in Derbyshire, I understand.”
“Yes,” replied Mr. Wickham; “his estate there is a noble one. A clear ten
thousand per annum. You could not have met with a person more capable of
giving you certain information on that head than myself, for I have been
connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy.”
Elizabeth could not but look surprised.
“You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, after
seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday.
Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?”
“As much as I ever wish to be,” cried Elizabeth very warmly. “I have spent
four days in the same house with him, and I think him very disagreeable.”
“I have no right to give my opinion,” said Wickham, “as to his being
agreeable or otherwise. I am not qualified to form one. I have known him too
long and too well to be a fair judge. It is impossible for me to be impartial. But
I believe your opinion of him would in general astonish—and perhaps you
would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else. Here you are in your
own family.”
“Upon my word, I say no more here than I might say in any house in the
neighbourhood, except Netherfield. He is not at all liked in Hertfordshire.
Everybody is disgusted with his pride. You will not find him more favourably
spoken of by anyone.”
“I cannot pretend to be sorry,” said Wickham, after a short interruption,
“that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts; but with
him I believe it does not often happen. The world is blinded by his fortune and
consequence, or frightened by his high and imposing manners, and sees him
only as he chooses to be seen.”
“I should take him, even on my slight acquaintance, to be an ill-tempered
man.” Wickham only shook his head.
“I wonder,” said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, “whether he is
likely to be in this country much longer.”
“I do not at all know; but I heard nothing of his going away when I was at
Netherfield. I hope your plans in favour of the ——shire will not be affected
by his being in the neighbourhood.”
“Oh! no—it is not for me to be driven away by Mr. Darcy. If he wishes to
avoid seeing me, he must go. We are not on friendly terms, and it always gives
me pain to meet him, but I have no reason for avoiding him but what I might
proclaim before all the world, a sense of very great ill-usage, and most painful
regrets at his being what he is. His father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr. Darcy, was
one of the best men that ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I
can never be in company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul
by a thousand tender recollections. His behaviour to myself has been
scandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him anything and everything,
rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his
father.”
Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with all
her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry.
Mr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the
neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet
seen, and speaking of the latter with gentle but very intelligible gallantry.
“It was the prospect of constant society, and good society,” he added,
“which was my chief inducement to enter the ——shire. I knew it to be a most
respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend Denny tempted me further by his
account of their present quarters, and the very great attentions and excellent
acquaintances Meryton had procured them. Society, I own, is necessary to me.
I have been a disappointed man, and my spirits will not bear solitude. I must
have employment and society. A military life is not what I was intended for,
but circumstances have now made it eligible. The church ought to have been
my profession—I was brought up for the church, and I should at this time have
been in possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we
were speaking of just now.”
“Indeed!”
“Yes—the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best
living in his gift. He was my godfather, and excessively attached to me. I
cannot do justice to his kindness. He meant to provide for me amply, and
thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given elsewhere.”
“Good heavens!” cried Elizabeth; “but how could that be? How could his
will be disregarded? Why did you not seek legal redress?”
“There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give
me no hope from law. A man of honour could not have doubted the intention,
but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it—or to treat it as a merely conditional
recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim to it by
extravagance, imprudence—in short anything or nothing. Certain it is, that the
living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I was of an age to hold it, and
that it was given to another man; and no less certain is it, that I cannot accuse
myself of having really done anything to deserve to lose it. I have a warm,
unguarded temper, and I may have spoken my opinion of him, and to him, too
freely. I can recall nothing worse. But the fact is, that we are very different sort
of men, and that he hates me.”
“This is quite shocking! He deserves to be publicly disgraced.”
“Some time or other he will be—but it shall not be by me. Till I can forget
his father, I can never defy or expose him.”
Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than
ever as he expressed them.
“But what,” said she, after a pause, “can have been his motive? What can
have induced him to behave so cruelly?”
“A thorough, determined dislike of me—a dislike which I cannot but
attribute in some measure to jealousy. Had the late Mr. Darcy liked me less,
his son might have borne with me better; but his father’s uncommon
attachment to me irritated him, I believe, very early in life. He had not a
temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood—the sort of
preference which was often given me.”
“I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this—though I have never liked
him. I had not thought so very ill of him. I had supposed him to be despising
his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of descending to such
malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as this.”
After a few minutes’ reflection, however, she continued, “I do remember
his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of his resentments, of
his having an unforgiving temper. His disposition must be dreadful.”
“I will not trust myself on the subject,” replied Wickham; “I can hardly be
just to him.”
Elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, “To treat
in such a manner the godson, the friend, the favourite of his father!” She could
have added, “A young man, too, like you, whose very countenance may vouch
for your being amiable”—but she contented herself with, “and one, too, who
had probably been his companion from childhood, connected together, as I
think you said, in the closest manner!”
“We were born in the same parish, within the same park; the greatest part
of our youth was passed together; inmates of the same house, sharing the same
amusements, objects of the same parental care. My father began life in the
profession which your uncle, Mr. Phillips, appears to do so much credit to—
but he gave up everything to be of use to the late Mr. Darcy and devoted all his
time to the care of the Pemberley property. He was most highly esteemed by
Mr. Darcy, a most intimate, confidential friend. Mr. Darcy often acknowledged
himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father’s active
superintendence, and when, immediately before my father’s death, Mr. Darcy
gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt
it to be as much a debt of gratitude to him, as of his affection to myself.”
“How strange!” cried Elizabeth. “How abominable! I wonder that the very
pride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you! If from no better motive,
that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest—for dishonesty I must
call it.”
“It is wonderful,” replied Wickham, “for almost all his actions may be
traced to pride; and pride had often been his best friend. It has connected him
nearer with virtue than with any other feeling. But we are none of us
consistent, and in his behaviour to me there were stronger impulses even than
pride.”
“Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?”
“Yes. It has often led him to be liberal and generous, to give his money
freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve the poor. Family
pride, and filial pride—for he is very proud of what his father was—have done
this. Not to appear to disgrace his family, to degenerate from the popular
qualities, or lose the influence of the Pemberley House, is a powerful motive.
He has also brotherly pride, which, with some brotherly affection, makes him
a very kind and careful guardian of his sister, and you will hear him generally
cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers.”
“What sort of girl is Miss Darcy?”
He shook his head. “I wish I could call her amiable. It gives me pain to
speak ill of a Darcy. But she is too much like her brother—very, very proud.
As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond of me; and I
have devoted hours and hours to her amusement. But she is nothing to me
now. She is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen, and, I understand, highly
accomplished. Since her father’s death, her home has been London, where a
lady lives with her, and superintends her education.”
After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could not
help reverting once more to the first, and saying:
“I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley! How can Mr. Bingley,
who seems good humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable, be in
friendship with such a man? How can they suit each other? Do you know Mr.
Bingley?”
“Not at all.”
“He is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man. He cannot know what
Mr. Darcy is.”
“Probably not; but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses. He does not
want abilities. He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his
while. Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is a very
different man from what he is to the less prosperous. His pride never deserts
him; but with the rich he is liberal-minded, just, sincere, rational, honourable,
and perhaps agreeable—allowing something for fortune and figure.”
The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round
the other table and Mr. Collins took his station between his cousin Elizabeth
and Mrs. Phillips. The usual inquiries as to his success were made by the
latter. It had not been very great; he had lost every point; but when Mrs.
Phillips began to express her concern thereupon, he assured her with much
earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance, that he considered the
money as a mere trifle, and begged that she would not make herself uneasy.
“I know very well, madam,” said he, “that when persons sit down to a
card-table, they must take their chances of these things, and happily I am not
in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object. There are
undoubtedly many who could not say the same, but thanks to Lady Catherine
de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters.”
Mr. Wickham’s attention was caught; and after observing Mr. Collins for a
few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation was very
intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh.
“Lady Catherine de Bourgh,” she replied, “has very lately given him a
living. I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to her notice, but
he certainly has not known her long.”
“You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne
Darcy were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr. Darcy.”
“No, indeed, I did not. I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine’s
connections. I never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday.”
“Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is
believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates.”
This information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss
Bingley. Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her affection
for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already self-destined for
another.
“Mr. Collins,” said she, “speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her
daughter; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship, I
suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her being his patroness,
she is an arrogant, conceited woman.”
“I believe her to be both in a great degree,” replied Wickham; “I have not
seen her for many years, but I very well remember that I never liked her, and
that her manners were dictatorial and insolent. She has the reputation of being
remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe she derives part of her
abilities from her rank and fortune, part from her authoritative manner, and the
rest from the pride for her nephew, who chooses that everyone connected with
him should have an understanding of the first class.”
Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and they
continued talking together, with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to
cards, and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr. Wickham’s attentions.
There could be no conversation in the noise of Mrs. Phillips’s supper party, but
his manners recommended him to everybody. Whatever he said, was said well;
and whatever he did, done gracefully. Elizabeth went away with her head full
of him. She could think of nothing but of Mr. Wickham, and of what he had
told her, all the way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his
name as they went, for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent. Lydia
talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the fish she
had won; and Mr. Collins in describing the civility of Mr. and Mrs. Phillips,
protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist, enumerating all
the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing that he crowded his cousins, had
more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at
Longbourn House.
Chapter 17
Elizabeth related to Jane the next day what had passed between Mr.
Wickham and herself. Jane listened with astonishment and concern; she knew
not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr. Bingley’s
regard; and yet, it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young
man of such amiable appearance as Wickham. The possibility of his having
endured such unkindness, was enough to interest all her tender feelings; and
nothing remained therefore to be done, but to think well of them both, to
defend the conduct of each, and throw into the account of accident or mistake
whatever could not be otherwise explained.
“They have both,” said she, “been deceived, I dare say, in some way or
other, of which we can form no idea. Interested people have perhaps
misrepresented each to the other. It is, in short, impossible for us to conjecture
the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them, without actual
blame on either side.”
“Very true, indeed; and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to say on
behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the
business? Do clear them too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody.”
“Laugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me out of my
opinion. My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places
Mr. Darcy, to be treating his father’s favourite in such a manner, one whom his
father had promised to provide for. It is impossible. No man of common
humanity, no man who had any value for his character, could be capable of it.
Can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him? Oh! no.”
“I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley’s being imposed on, than that
Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night;
names, facts, everything mentioned without ceremony. If it be not so, let Mr.
Darcy contradict it. Besides, there was truth in his looks.”
“It is difficult indeed—it is distressing. One does not know what to think.”
“I beg your pardon; one knows exactly what to think.”
But Jane could think with certainty on only one point—that Mr. Bingley, if
he had been imposed on, would have much to suffer when the affair became
public.
The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery, where this
conversation passed, by the arrival of the very persons of whom they had been
speaking; Mr. Bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for
the long-expected ball at Netherfield, which was fixed for the following
Tuesday. The two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again, called it
an age since they had met, and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with
herself since their separation. To the rest of the family they paid little
attention; avoiding Mrs. Bennet as much as possible, saying not much to
Elizabeth, and nothing at all to the others. They were soon gone again, rising
from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise, and
hurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs. Bennet’s civilities.
The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every
female of the family. Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment
to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation
from Mr. Bingley himself, instead of a ceremonious card. Jane pictured to
herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends, and the attentions of
their brother; and Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with
Mr. Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of everything in Mr. Darcy’s look
and behaviour. The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia depended
less on any single event, or any particular person, for though they each, like
Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham, he was by no
means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a ball was, at any rate, a
ball. And even Mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for
it.
“While I can have my mornings to myself,” said she, “it is enough—I think
it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements. Society has
claims on us all; and I profess myself one of those who consider intervals of
recreation and amusement as desirable for everybody.”
Elizabeth’s spirits were so high on this occasion, that though she did not
often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, she could not help asking him
whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley’s invitation, and if he did, whether
he would think it proper to join in the evening’s amusement; and she was
rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head,
and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the Archbishop, or Lady
Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to dance.
“I am by no means of the opinion, I assure you,” said he, “that a ball of this
kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people, can have any
evil tendency; and I am so far from objecting to dancing myself, that I shall
hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the
evening; and I take this opportunity of soliciting yours, Miss Elizabeth, for the
two first dances especially, a preference which I trust my cousin Jane will
attribute to the right cause, and not to any disrespect for her.”
Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in. She had fully proposed being
engaged by Mr. Wickham for those very dances; and to have Mr. Collins
instead! her liveliness had never been worse timed. There was no help for it,
however. Mr. Wickham’s happiness and her own were perforce delayed a little
longer, and Mr. Collins’s proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could.
She was not the better pleased with his gallantry from the idea it suggested of
something more. It now first struck her, that she was selected from among her
sisters as worthy of being mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to
form a quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors. The
idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing civilities
toward herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and
vivacity; and though more astonished than gratified herself by this effect of
her charms, it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the
probability of their marriage was extremely agreeable to her. Elizabeth,
however, did not choose to take the hint, being well aware that a serious
dispute must be the consequence of any reply. Mr. Collins might never make
the offer, and till he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.
If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the
younger Miss Bennets would have been in a very pitiable state at this time, for
from the day of the invitation, to the day of the ball, there was such a
succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once. No aunt, no
officers, no news could be sought after—the very shoe-roses for Netherfield
were got by proxy. Even Elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience
in weather which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with
Mr. Wickham; and nothing less than a dance on Tuesday, could have made
such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday endurable to Kitty and Lydia.
Chapter 18
Till Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield, and looked in vain
for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a doubt of
his being present had never occurred to her. The certainty of meeting him had
not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably
have alarmed her. She had dressed with more than usual care, and prepared in
the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart,
trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening.
But in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted
for Mr. Darcy’s pleasure in the Bingleys’ invitation to the officers; and though
this was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced
by his friend Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and who told them that
Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before, and was
not yet returned; adding, with a significant smile, “I do not imagine his
business would have called him away just now, if he had not wanted to avoid a
certain gentleman here.”
This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught by
Elizabeth, and, as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for
Wickham’s absence than if her first surmise had been just, every feeling of
displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate
disappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite
inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make. Attendance,
forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham. She was resolved
against any sort of conversation with him, and turned away with a degree of
ill-humour which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to Mr.
Bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her.
But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect of
her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her spirits;
and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she had not seen for a
week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her
cousin, and to point him out to her particular notice. The first two dances,
however, brought a return of distress; they were dances of mortification. Mr.
Collins, awkward and solemn, apologising instead of attending, and often
moving wrong without being aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery
which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give. The moment of
her release from him was ecstasy.
She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of
Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked. When those dances
were over, she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with her,
when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy who took her so
much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without knowing what
she did, she accepted him. He walked away again immediately, and she was
left to fret over her own want of presence of mind; Charlotte tried to console
her:
“I dare say you will find him very agreeable.”
“Heaven forbid! That would be the greatest misfortune of all! To find a
man agreeable whom one is determined to hate! Do not wish me such an evil.”
When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim
her hand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper, not to be a
simpleton, and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant in
the eyes of a man ten times his consequence. Elizabeth made no answer, and
took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in
being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and reading in her neighbours’
looks, their equal amazement in beholding it. They stood for some time
without speaking a word; and she began to imagine that their silence was to
last through the two dances, and at first was resolved not to break it; till
suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to
oblige him to talk, she made some slight observation on the dance. He replied,
and was again silent. After a pause of some minutes, she addressed him a
second time with:—“It is your turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy. I talked
about the dance, and you ought to make some sort of remark on the size of the
room, or the number of couples.”
He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be
said.
“Very well. That reply will do for the present. Perhaps by and by I may
observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones. But now we
may be silent.”
“Do you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?”
“Sometimes. One must speak a little, you know. It would look odd to be
entirely silent for half an hour together; and yet for the advantage of some,
conversation ought to be so arranged, as that they may have the trouble of
saying as little as possible.”
“Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you
imagine that you are gratifying mine?”
“Both,” replied Elizabeth archly; “for I have always seen a great similarity
in the turn of our minds. We are each of an unsocial, taciturn disposition,
unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say something that will amaze the
whole room, and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb.”
“This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure,”
said he. “How near it may be to mine, I cannot pretend to say. You think it a
faithful portrait undoubtedly.”
“I must not decide on my own performance.”
He made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone down the
dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to
Meryton. She answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist the temptation,
added, “When you met us there the other day, we had just been forming a new
acquaintance.”
The effect was immediate. A deeper shade of hauteur overspread his
features, but he said not a word, and Elizabeth, though blaming herself for her
own weakness, could not go on. At length Darcy spoke, and in a constrained
manner said, “Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may
ensure his making friends—whether he may be equally capable of retaining
them, is less certain.”
“He has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship,” replied Elizabeth with
emphasis, “and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life.”
Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject. At
that moment, Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass
through the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving Mr. Darcy, he
stopped with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing
and his partner.
“I have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear sir. Such very superior
dancing is not often seen. It is evident that you belong to the first circles.
Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not disgrace you, and
that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated, especially when a certain
desirable event, my dear Eliza (glancing at her sister and Bingley) shall take
place. What congratulations will then flow in! I appeal to Mr. Darcy:—but let
me not interrupt you, sir. You will not thank me for detaining you from the
bewitching converse of that young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding
me.”
The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but Sir
William’s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his eyes
were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and Jane, who
were dancing together. Recovering himself, however, shortly, he turned to his
partner, and said, “Sir William’s interruption has made me forget what we
were talking of.”
“I do not think we were speaking at all. Sir William could not have
interrupted two people in the room who had less to say for themselves. We
have tried two or three subjects already without success, and what we are to
talk of next I cannot imagine.”
“What think you of books?” said he, smiling.
“Books—oh! no. I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same
feelings.”
“I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be no
want of subject. We may compare our different opinions.”
“No—I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of
something else.”
“The present always occupies you in such scenes—does it?” said he, with a
look of doubt.
“Yes, always,” she replied, without knowing what she said, for her
thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared by
her suddenly exclaiming, “I remember hearing you once say, Mr. Darcy, that
you hardly ever forgave, that your resentment once created was unappeasable.
You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its being created.”
“I am,” said he, with a firm voice.
“And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?”
“I hope not.”
“It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion, to
be secure of judging properly at first.”
“May I ask to what these questions tend?”
“Merely to the illustration of your character,” said she, endeavouring to
shake off her gravity. “I am trying to make it out.”
“And what is your success?”
She shook her head. “I do not get on at all. I hear such different accounts
of you as puzzle me exceedingly.”
“I can readily believe,” answered he gravely, “that reports may vary greatly
with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were not to sketch
my character at the present moment, as there is reason to fear that the
performance would reflect no credit on either.”
“But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another
opportunity.”
“I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours,” he coldly replied.
She said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in silence;
and on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree, for in Darcy’s
breast there was a tolerably powerful feeling towards her, which soon
procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against another.
They had not long separated, when Miss Bingley came towards her, and
with an expression of civil disdain accosted her:
“So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham!
Your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a thousand
questions; and I find that the young man quite forgot to tell you, among his
other communication, that he was the son of old Wickham, the late Mr.
Darcy’s steward. Let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to give
implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr. Darcy’s using him ill, it
is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he has always been remarkably kind to
him, though George Wickham has treated Mr. Darcy in a most infamous
manner. I do not know the particulars, but I know very well that Mr. Darcy is
not in the least to blame, that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham
mentioned, and that though my brother thought that he could not well avoid
including him in his invitation to the officers, he was excessively glad to find
that he had taken himself out of the way. His coming into the country at all is a
most insolent thing, indeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it. I pity
you, Miss Eliza, for this discovery of your favourite’s guilt; but really,
considering his descent, one could not expect much better.”
“His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same,” said
Elizabeth angrily; “for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of
being the son of Mr. Darcy’s steward, and of that, I can assure you, he
informed me himself.”
“I beg your pardon,” replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer.
“Excuse my interference—it was kindly meant.”
“Insolent girl!” said Elizabeth to herself. “You are much mistaken if you
expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this. I see nothing in it but
your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr. Darcy.” She then sought her
eldest sister, who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of
Bingley. Jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency, a glow of such
happy expression, as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the
occurrences of the evening. Elizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that
moment solicitude for Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and
everything else, gave way before the hope of Jane’s being in the fairest way
for happiness.
“I want to know,” said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her
sister’s, “what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham. But perhaps you have
been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which case you
may be sure of my pardon.”
“No,” replied Jane, “I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing
satisfactory to tell you. Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of his history,
and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended Mr.
Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct, the probity, and honour of his
friend, and is perfectly convinced that Mr. Wickham has deserved much less
attention from Mr. Darcy than he has received; and I am sorry to say by his
account as well as his sister’s, Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable
young man. I am afraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose
Mr. Darcy’s regard.”
“Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?”
“No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.”
“This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy. I am satisfied.
But what does he say of the living?”
“He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard
them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to him
conditionally only.”
“I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley’s sincerity,” said Elizabeth warmly;
“but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only. Mr.
Bingley’s defense of his friend was a very able one, I dare say; but since he is
unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt the rest from that
friend himself, I shall venture to still think of both gentlemen as I did before.”
She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on
which there could be no difference of sentiment. Elizabeth listened with
delight to the happy, though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Mr.
Bingley’s regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it. On
their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew to Miss Lucas;
to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely
replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them, and told her with great exultation
that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery.
“I have found out,” said he, “by a singular accident, that there is now in the
room a near relation of my patroness. I happened to overhear the gentleman
himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of the house the
names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother Lady Catherine. How
wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would have thought of my
meeting with, perhaps, a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh in this
assembly! I am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay
my respects to him, which I am now going to do, and trust he will excuse my
not having done it before. My total ignorance of the connection must plead my
apology.”
“You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy!”
“Indeed I am. I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier. I
believe him to be Lady Catherine’s nephew. It will be in my power to assure
him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se’nnight.”
Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme, assuring him that
Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an
impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that it was not in
the least necessary there should be any notice on either side; and that if it
were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in consequence, to begin the
acquaintance. Mr. Collins listened to her with the determined air of following
his own inclination, and, when she ceased speaking, replied thus:
“My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world in your
excellent judgement in all matters within the scope of your understanding; but
permit me to say, that there must be a wide difference between the established
forms of ceremony amongst the laity, and those which regulate the clergy; for,
give me leave to observe that I consider the clerical office as equal in point of
dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom—provided that a proper humility
of behaviour is at the same time maintained. You must therefore allow me to
follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to
perform what I look on as a point of duty. Pardon me for neglecting to profit
by your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant guide,
though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education and
habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself.” And
with a low bow he left her to attack Mr. Darcy, whose reception of his
advances she eagerly watched, and whose astonishment at being so addressed
was very evident. Her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow and
though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if hearing it all, and saw in
the motion of his lips the words “apology,” “Hunsford,” and “Lady Catherine
de Bourgh.” It vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man. Mr. Darcy
was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder, and when at last Mr. Collins
allowed him time to speak, replied with an air of distant civility. Mr. Collins,
however, was not discouraged from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy’s contempt
seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech, and at the
end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way. Mr. Collins
then returned to Elizabeth.
“I have no reason, I assure you,” said he, “to be dissatisfied with my
reception. Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention. He answered
me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying that
he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine’s discernment as to be certain she
could never bestow a favour unworthily. It was really a very handsome
thought. Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him.”
As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned
her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley; and the train of
agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to, made her perhaps
almost as happy as Jane. She saw her in idea settled in that very house, in all
the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow; and she felt
capable, under such circumstances, of endeavouring even to like Bingley’s two
sisters. Her mother’s thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way, and
she determined not to venture near her, lest she might hear too much. When
they sat down to supper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky
perverseness which placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she
vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas)
freely, openly, and of nothing else but her expectation that Jane would soon be
married to Mr. Bingley. It was an animating subject, and Mrs. Bennet seemed
incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match. His being
such a charming young man, and so rich, and living but three miles from them,
were the first points of self-gratulation; and then it was such a comfort to think
how fond the two sisters were of Jane, and to be certain that they must desire
the connection as much as she could do. It was, moreover, such a promising
thing for her younger daughters, as Jane’s marrying so greatly must throw
them in the way of other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of
life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that
she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked. It was
necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on such
occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs. Bennet to
find comfort in staying home at any period of her life. She concluded with
many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally fortunate, though
evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it.
In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother’s
words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper; for, to
her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the chief of it was
overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them. Her mother only scolded
her for being nonsensical.
“What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him? I am sure
we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing he may
not like to hear.”
“For heaven’s sake, madam, speak lower. What advantage can it be for you
to offend Mr. Darcy? You will never recommend yourself to his friend by so
doing!”
Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence. Her mother would
talk of her views in the same intelligible tone. Elizabeth blushed and blushed
again with shame and vexation. She could not help frequently glancing her eye
at Mr. Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded; for
though he was not always looking at her mother, she was convinced that his
attention was invariably fixed by her. The expression of his face changed
gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity.
At length, however, Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who
had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no
likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken.
Elizabeth now began to revive. But not long was the interval of tranquillity;
for, when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she had the
mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty, preparing to oblige the
company. By many significant looks and silent entreaties, did she endeavour
to prevent such a proof of complaisance, but in vain; Mary would not
understand them; such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and
she began her song. Elizabeth’s eyes were fixed on her with most painful
sensations, and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an
impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving,
amongst the thanks of the table, the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed
on to favour them again, after the pause of half a minute began another.
Mary’s powers were by no means fitted for such a display; her voice was
weak, and her manner affected. Elizabeth was in agonies. She looked at Jane,
to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly talking to Bingley. She
looked at his two sisters, and saw them making signs of derision at each other,
and at Darcy, who continued, however, imperturbably grave. She looked at her
father to entreat his interference, lest Mary should be singing all night. He
took the hint, and when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud, “That
will do extremely well, child. You have delighted us long enough. Let the
other young ladies have time to exhibit.”
Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and
Elizabeth, sorry for her, and sorry for her father’s speech, was afraid her
anxiety had done no good. Others of the party were now applied to.
“If I,” said Mr. Collins, “were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I should
have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an air; for I
consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly compatible with the
profession of a clergyman. I do not mean, however, to assert that we can be
justified in devoting too much of our time to music, for there are certainly
other things to be attended to. The rector of a parish has much to do. In the
first place, he must make such an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to
himself and not offensive to his patron. He must write his own sermons; and
the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care
and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making as
comfortable as possible. And I do not think it of light importance that he
should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards everybody, especially
towards those to whom he owes his preferment. I cannot acquit him of that
duty; nor could I think well of the man who should omit an occasion of
testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the family.” And with a
bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded his speech, which had been spoken so loud as
to be heard by half the room. Many stared—many smiled; but no one looked
more amused than Mr. Bennet himself, while his wife seriously commended
Mr. Collins for having spoken so sensibly, and observed in a half-whisper to
Lady Lucas, that he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young man.
To Elizabeth it appeared that, had her family made an agreement to expose
themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would have been
impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or finer success; and
happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition
had escaped his notice, and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much
distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed. That his two sisters and
Mr. Darcy, however, should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her
relations, was bad enough, and she could not determine whether the silent
contempt of the gentleman, or the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more
intolerable.
The rest of the evening brought her little amusement. She was teased by
Mr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side, and though he
could not prevail on her to dance with him again, put it out of her power to
dance with others. In vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else,
and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room. He assured her, that
as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it; that his chief object was by
delicate attentions to recommend himself to her and that he should therefore
make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening. There was no
arguing upon such a project. She owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss
Lucas, who often joined them, and good-naturedly engaged Mr. Collins’s
conversation to herself.
She was at least free from the offense of Mr. Darcy’s further notice; though
often standing within a very short distance of her, quite disengaged, he never
came near enough to speak. She felt it to be the probable consequence of her
allusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced in it.
The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart, and, by a
manoeuvre of Mrs. Bennet, had to wait for their carriage a quarter of an hour
after everybody else was gone, which gave them time to see how heartily they
were wished away by some of the family. Mrs. Hurst and her sister scarcely
opened their mouths, except to complain of fatigue, and were evidently
impatient to have the house to themselves. They repulsed every attempt of
Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and by so doing threw a languor over the whole
party, which was very little relieved by the long speeches of Mr. Collins, who
was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their
entertainment, and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their
behaviour to their guests. Darcy said nothing at all. Mr. Bennet, in equal
silence, was enjoying the scene. Mr. Bingley and Jane were standing together,
a little detached from the rest, and talked only to each other. Elizabeth
preserved as steady a silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even
Lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of
“Lord, how tired I am!” accompanied by a violent yawn.
When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most pressingly
civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn, and addressed
herself especially to Mr. Bingley, to assure him how happy he would make
them by eating a family dinner with them at any time, without the ceremony of
a formal invitation. Bingley was all grateful pleasure, and he readily engaged
for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her, after his return from
London, whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time.
Mrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied, and quitted the house under the
delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of
settlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly see
her daughter settled at Netherfield in the course of three or four months. Of
having another daughter married to Mr. Collins, she thought with equal
certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure. Elizabeth was the
least dear to her of all her children; and though the man and the match were
quite good enough for her, the worth of each was eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and
Netherfield.
Chapter 19
The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn. Mr. Collins made his
declaration in form. Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as his leave
of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having no feelings of
diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment, he set about it
in a very orderly manner, with all the observances, which he supposed a
regular part of the business. On finding Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the
younger girls together, soon after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these
words:
“May I hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth,
when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of
this morning?”
Before Elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise, Mrs.
Bennet answered instantly, “Oh dear!—yes—certainly. I am sure Lizzy will be
very happy—I am sure she can have no objection. Come, Kitty, I want you up
stairs.” And, gathering her work together, she was hastening away, when
Elizabeth called out:
“Dear madam, do not go. I beg you will not go. Mr. Collins must excuse
me. He can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear. I am going
away myself.”
“No, no, nonsense, Lizzy. I desire you to stay where you are.” And upon
Elizabeth’s seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about to
escape, she added: “Lizzy, I insist upon your staying and hearing Mr. Collins.”
Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction—and a moment’s
consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as
soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again and tried to conceal, by
incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and
diversion. Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as soon as they were gone,
Mr. Collins began.
“Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from doing
you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections. You would have
been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little unwillingness; but
allow me to assure you, that I have your respected mother’s permission for this
address. You can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse, however your
natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble; my attentions have been too
marked to be mistaken. Almost as soon as I entered the house, I singled you
out as the companion of my future life. But before I am run away with by my
feelings on this subject, perhaps it would be advisable for me to state my
reasons for marrying—and, moreover, for coming into Hertfordshire with the
design of selecting a wife, as I certainly did.”
The idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away
with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing, that she could not use
the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him further, and he
continued:
“My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for every
clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example of
matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I am convinced that it will add very
greatly to my happiness; and thirdly—which perhaps I ought to have
mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the
very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness. Twice has she
condescended to give me her opinion (unasked too!) on this subject; and it was
but the very Saturday night before I left Hunsford—between our pools at
quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson was arranging Miss de Bourgh’s footstool,
that she said, ‘Mr. Collins, you must marry. A clergyman like you must marry.
Choose properly, choose a gentlewoman for my sake; and for your own, let
her be an active, useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a
small income go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a woman as soon as
you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.’ Allow me, by the way, to
observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and kindness of Lady
Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to
offer. You will find her manners beyond anything I can describe; and your wit
and vivacity, I think, must be acceptable to her, especially when tempered with
the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite. Thus much for
my general intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my
views were directed towards Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood,
where I can assure you there are many amiable young women. But the fact is,
that being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father
(who, however, may live many years longer), I could not satisfy myself
without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters, that the loss to
them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy event takes place—
which, however, as I have already said, may not be for several years. This has
been my motive, my fair cousin, and I flatter myself it will not sink me in your
esteem. And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most
animated language of the violence of my affection. To fortune I am perfectly
indifferent, and shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am
well aware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds in
the four per cents, which will not be yours till after your mother’s decease, is
all that you may ever be entitled to. On that head, therefore, I shall be
uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach
shall ever pass my lips when we are married.”
It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.
“You are too hasty, sir,” she cried. “You forget that I have made no answer.
Let me do it without further loss of time. Accept my thanks for the
compliment you are paying me. I am very sensible of the honour of your
proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than to decline them.”
“I am not now to learn,” replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave of the
hand, “that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man
whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their favour; and
that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second, or even a third time. I am
therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said, and shall hope
to lead you to the altar ere long.”
“Upon my word, sir,” cried Elizabeth, “your hope is a rather extraordinary
one after my declaration. I do assure you that I am not one of those young
ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so daring as to risk their
happiness on the chance of being asked a second time. I am perfectly serious
in my refusal. You could not make me happy, and I am convinced that I am the
last woman in the world who could make you so. Nay, were your friend Lady
Catherine to know me, I am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill
qualified for the situation.”
“Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so,” said Mr. Collins very
gravely—“but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of
you. And you may be certain when I have the honour of seeing her again, I
shall speak in the very highest terms of your modesty, economy, and other
amiable qualification.”
“Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary. You must give
me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment of believing what I
say. I wish you very happy and very rich, and by refusing your hand, do all in
my power to prevent your being otherwise. In making me the offer, you must
have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family, and may
take possession of Longbourn estate whenever it falls, without any selfreproach. This matter may be considered, therefore, as finally settled.” And
rising as she thus spoke, she would have quitted the room, had Mr. Collins not
thus addressed her:
“When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject, I
shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me;
though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I know it to
be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application,
and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would
be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character.”
“Really, Mr. Collins,” cried Elizabeth with some warmth, “you puzzle me
exceedingly. If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of
encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as to
convince you of its being one.”
“You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your
refusal of my addresses is merely words of course. My reasons for believing it
are briefly these: It does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy of your
acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer would be any other than
highly desirable. My situation in life, my connections with the family of de
Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are circumstances highly in my
favour; and you should take it into further consideration, that in spite of your
manifold attractions, it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage
may ever be made you. Your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all
likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications. As I
must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, I
shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense,
according to the usual practice of elegant females.”
“I do assure you, sir, that I have no pretensions whatever to that kind of
elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man. I would rather be
paid the compliment of being believed sincere. I thank you again and again for
the honour you have done me in your proposals, but to accept them is
absolutely impossible. My feelings in every respect forbid it. Can I speak
plainer? Do not consider me now as an elegant female, intending to plague
you, but as a rational creature, speaking the truth from her heart.”
“You are uniformly charming!” cried he, with an air of awkward gallantry;
“and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both
your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of being acceptable.”
To such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would make no
reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, if he persisted in
considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement, to apply to her
father, whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as to be decisive,
and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and
coquetry of an elegant female.
Chapter 20
Mr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful
love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the
end of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth open the door and with quick
step pass her towards the staircase, than she entered the breakfast-room, and
congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of
their nearer connection. Mr. Collins received and returned these felicitations
with equal pleasure, and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their
interview, with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be
satisfied, since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would
naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her
character.
This information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet; she would have been glad
to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by
protesting against his proposals, but she dared not believe it, and could not
help saying so.
“But, depend upon it, Mr. Collins,” she added, “that Lizzy shall be brought
to reason. I will speak to her about it directly. She is a very headstrong, foolish
girl, and does not know her own interest but I will make her know it.”
“Pardon me for interrupting you, madam,” cried Mr. Collins; “but if she is
really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she would altogether be a
very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who naturally looks for
happiness in the marriage state. If therefore she actually persists in rejecting
my suit, perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me, because if
liable to such defects of temper, she could not contribute much to my felicity.”
“Sir, you quite misunderstand me,” said Mrs. Bennet, alarmed. “Lizzy is
only headstrong in such matters as these. In everything else she is as goodnatured a girl as ever lived. I will go directly to Mr. Bennet, and we shall very
soon settle it with her, I am sure.”
She would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her
husband, called out as she entered the library, “Oh! Mr. Bennet, you are
wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar. You must come and make Lizzy
marry Mr. Collins, for she vows she will not have him, and if you do not make
haste he will change his mind and not have her.”
Mr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them on
her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her
communication.
“I have not the pleasure of understanding you,” said he, when she had
finished her speech. “Of what are you talking?”
“Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy. Lizzy declares she will not have Mr. Collins,
and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy.”
“And what am I to do on the occasion? It seems an hopeless business.”
“Speak to Lizzy about it yourself. Tell her that you insist upon her
marrying him.”
“Let her be called down. She shall hear my opinion.”
Mrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the
library.
“Come here, child,” cried her father as she appeared. “I have sent for you
on an affair of importance. I understand that Mr. Collins has made you an offer
of marriage. Is it true?” Elizabeth replied that it was. “Very well—and this
offer of marriage you have refused?”
“I have, sir.”
“Very well. We now come to the point. Your mother insists upon your
accepting it. Is it not so, Mrs. Bennet?”
“Yes, or I will never see her again.”
“An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth. From this day you must
be a stranger to one of your parents. Your mother will never see you again if
you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do.”
Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning, but
Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair
as she wished, was excessively disappointed.
“What do you mean, Mr. Bennet, in talking this way? You promised me to
insist upon her marrying him.”
“My dear,” replied her husband, “I have two small favours to request. First,
that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present
occasion; and secondly, of my room. I shall be glad to have the library to
myself as soon as may be.”
Not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did Mrs.
Bennet give up the point. She talked to Elizabeth again and again; coaxed and
threatened her by turns. She endeavoured to secure Jane in her interest; but
Jane, with all possible mildness, declined interfering; and Elizabeth,
sometimes with real earnestness, and sometimes with playful gaiety, replied to
her attacks. Though her manner varied, however, her determination never did.
Mr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed. He
thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motives his cousin could
refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other way. His
regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her deserving her
mother’s reproach prevented his feeling any regret.
While the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to spend the
day with them. She was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying to her, cried
in a half whisper, “I am glad you are come, for there is such fun here! What do
you think has happened this morning? Mr. Collins has made an offer to Lizzy,
and she will not have him.”
Charlotte hardly had time to answer, before they were joined by Kitty, who
came to tell the same news; and no sooner had they entered the breakfastroom, where Mrs. Bennet was alone, than she likewise began on the subject,
calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion, and entreating her to persuade her
friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family. “Pray do, my dear
Miss Lucas,” she added in a melancholy tone, “for nobody is on my side,
nobody takes part with me. I am cruelly used, nobody feels for my poor
nerves.”
Charlotte’s reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth.
“Aye, there she comes,” continued Mrs. Bennet, “looking as unconcerned
as may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at York, provided she
can have her own way. But I tell you, Miss Lizzy—if you take it into your
head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way, you will never get a
husband at all—and I am sure I do not know who is to maintain you when
your father is dead. I shall not be able to keep you—and so I warn you. I have
done with you from this very day. I told you in the library, you know, that I
should never speak to you again, and you will find me as good as my word. I
have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children. Not that I have much
pleasure, indeed, in talking to anybody. People who suffer as I do from
nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking. Nobody can tell
what I suffer! But it is always so. Those who do not complain are never
pitied.”
Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that any attempt
to reason with her or soothe her would only increase the irritation. She talked
on, therefore, without interruption from any of them, till they were joined by
Mr. Collins, who entered the room with an air more stately than usual, and on
perceiving whom, she said to the girls, “Now, I do insist upon it, that you, all
of you, hold your tongues, and let me and Mr. Collins have a little
conversation together.”
Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty followed, but
Lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and Charlotte,
detained first by the civility of Mr. Collins, whose inquiries after herself and
all her family were very minute, and then by a little curiosity, satisfied herself
with walking to the window and pretending not to hear. In a doleful voice Mrs.
Bennet began the projected conversation: “Oh! Mr. Collins!”
“My dear madam,” replied he, “let us be for ever silent on this point. Far
be it from me,” he presently continued, in a voice that marked his displeasure,
“to resent the behaviour of your daughter. Resignation to inevitable evils is the
duty of us all; the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as I
have been in early preferment; and I trust I am resigned. Perhaps not the less
so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured
me with her hand; for I have often observed that resignation is never so perfect
as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our
estimation. You will not, I hope, consider me as showing any disrespect to
your family, my dear madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your
daughter’s favour, without having paid yourself and Mr. Bennet the
compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf. My
conduct may, I fear, be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from
your daughter’s lips instead of your own. But we are all liable to error. I have
certainly meant well through the whole affair. My object has been to secure an
amiable companion for myself, with due consideration for the advantage of all
your family, and if my manner has been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave
to apologise.”
Chapter 21
The discussion of Mr. Collins’s offer was now nearly at an end, and
Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily
attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusions of her mother. As
for the gentleman himself, his feelings were chiefly expressed, not by
embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by stiffness of
manner and resentful silence. He scarcely ever spoke to her, and the assiduous
attentions which he had been so sensible of himself were transferred for the
rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose civility in listening to him was a
seasonable relief to them all, and especially to her friend.
The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs. Bennet’s ill-humour or ill
health. Mr. Collins was also in the same state of angry pride. Elizabeth had
hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did not appear in
the least affected by it. He was always to have gone on Saturday, and to
Saturday he meant to stay.
After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr. Wickham
were returned, and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball. He
joined them on their entering the town, and attended them to their aunt’s where
his regret and vexation, and the concern of everybody, was well talked over.
To Elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his
absence had been self-imposed.
“I found,” said he, “as the time drew near that I had better not meet Mr.
Darcy; that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so many hours
together, might be more than I could bear, and that scenes might arise
unpleasant to more than myself.”
She highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure for a full
discussion of it, and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on
each other, as Wickham and another officer walked back with them to
Longbourn, and during the walk he particularly attended to her. His
accompanying them was a double advantage; she felt all the compliment it
offered to herself, and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing
him to her father and mother.
Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it came from
Netherfield. The envelope contained a sheet of elegant, little, hot-pressed
paper, well covered with a lady’s fair, flowing hand; and Elizabeth saw her
sister’s countenance change as she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on
some particular passages. Jane recollected herself soon, and putting the letter
away, tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation; but
Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from
Wickham; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave, than a glance
from Jane invited her to follow her up stairs. When they had gained their own
room, Jane, taking out the letter, said:
“This is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains has surprised me a good
deal. The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are on their way
to town—and without any intention of coming back again. You shall hear what
she says.”
She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information of
their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly, and of their
meaning to dine in Grosvenor Street, where Mr. Hurst had a house. The next
was in these words: “I do not pretend to regret anything I shall leave in
Hertfordshire, except your society, my dearest friend; but we will hope, at
some future period, to enjoy many returns of that delightful intercourse we
have known, and in the meanwhile may lessen the pain of separation by a very
frequent and most unreserved correspondence. I depend on you for that.” To
these highflown expressions Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of
distrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she saw
nothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed that their absence from
Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley’s being there; and as to the loss of their
society, she was persuaded that Jane must cease to regard it, in the enjoyment
of his.
“It is unlucky,” said she, after a short pause, “that you should not be able to
see your friends before they leave the country. But may we not hope that the
period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks forward may arrive
earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful intercourse you have known as
friends will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters? Mr. Bingley
will not be detained in London by them.”
“Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into
Hertfordshire this winter. I will read it to you:”
“When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which
took him to London might be concluded in three or four days; but as we are
certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when Charles gets
to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have determined on
following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in
a comfortless hotel. Many of my acquaintances are already there for the
winter; I wish that I could hear that you, my dearest friend, had any intention
of making one of the crowd—but of that I despair. I sincerely hope your
Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season
generally brings, and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your
feeling the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you.”
“It is evident by this,” added Jane, “that he comes back no more this
winter.”
“It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean that he should.”
“Why will you think so? It must be his own doing. He is his own master.
But you do not know all. I will read you the passage which particularly hurts
me. I will have no reserves from you.”
“Mr. Darcy is impatient to see his sister; and, to confess the truth, we are
scarcely less eager to meet her again. I really do not think Georgiana Darcy
has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the affection she
inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened into something still more
interesting, from the hope we dare entertain of her being hereafter our sister. I
do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this
subject; but I will not leave the country without confiding them, and I trust
you will not esteem them unreasonable. My brother admires her greatly
already; he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most
intimate footing; her relations all wish the connection as much as his own; and
a sister’s partiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most
capable of engaging any woman’s heart. With all these circumstances to
favour an attachment, and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest Jane,
in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so
many?”
“What do you think of this sentence, my dear Lizzy?” said Jane as she
finished it. “Is it not clear enough? Does it not expressly declare that Caroline
neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister; that she is perfectly convinced
of her brother’s indifference; and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings
for him, she means (most kindly!) to put me on my guard? Can there be any
other opinion on the subject?”
“Yes, there can; for mine is totally different. Will you hear it?”
“Most willingly.”
“You shall have it in a few words. Miss Bingley sees that her brother is in
love with you, and wants him to marry Miss Darcy. She follows him to town
in hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he does not care
about you.”
Jane shook her head.
“Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me. No one who has ever seen you
together can doubt his affection. Miss Bingley, I am sure, cannot. She is not
such a simpleton. Could she have seen half as much love in Mr. Darcy for
herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes. But the case is this: We
are not rich enough or grand enough for them; and she is the more anxious to
get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion that when there has been one
intermarriage, she may have less trouble in achieving a second; in which there
is certainly some ingenuity, and I dare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh
were out of the way. But, my dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that
because Miss Bingley tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is
in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of
you on Tuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that, instead of
being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend.”
“If we thought alike of Miss Bingley,” replied Jane, “your representation of
all this might make me quite easy. But I know the foundation is unjust.
Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving anyone; and all that I can hope in
this case is that she is deceiving herself.”
“That is right. You could not have started a more happy idea, since you
will not take comfort in mine. Believe her to be deceived, by all means. You
have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer.”
“But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in accepting
a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere?”
“You must decide for yourself,” said Elizabeth; “and if, upon mature
deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more
than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you by all means to
refuse him.”
“How can you talk so?” said Jane, faintly smiling. “You must know that
though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I could not
hesitate.”
“I did not think you would; and that being the case, I cannot consider your
situation with much compassion.”
“But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be required. A
thousand things may arise in six months!”
The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost
contempt. It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline’s interested
wishes, and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes, however
openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man so totally independent
of everyone.
She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the
subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect. Jane’s temper
was not desponding, and she was gradually led to hope, though the diffidence
of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that Bingley would return to
Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart.
They agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure of the
family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman’s conduct; but
even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern, and she
bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away
just as they were all getting so intimate together. After lamenting it, however,
at some length, she had the consolation that Mr. Bingley would be soon down
again and soon dining at Longbourn, and the conclusion of all was the
comfortable declaration, that though he had been invited only to a family
dinner, she would take care to have two full courses.
Chapter 22
The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases and again during the
chief of the day was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr. Collins. Elizabeth
took an opportunity of thanking her. “It keeps him in good humour,” said she,
“and I am more obliged to you than I can express.” Charlotte assured her
friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and that it amply repaid her for the
little sacrifice of her time. This was very amiable, but Charlotte’s kindness
extended farther than Elizabeth had any conception of; its object was nothing
else than to secure her from any return of Mr. Collins’s addresses, by engaging
them towards herself. Such was Miss Lucas’s scheme; and appearances were
so favourable, that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost
secure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon. But
here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character, for it led
him to escape out of Longbourn House the next morning with admirable
slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw himself at her feet. He was
anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins, from a conviction that if they saw
him depart, they could not fail to conjecture his design, and he was not willing
to have the attempt known till its success might be known likewise; for though
feeling almost secure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably
encouraging, he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of
Wednesday. His reception, however, was of the most flattering kind. Miss
Lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house,
and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane. But little had she
dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.
In as short a time as Mr. Collins’s long speeches would allow, everything
was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as they entered the
house he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the
happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must be waived for the
present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness. The stupidity
with which he was favoured by nature must guard his courtship from any
charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance; and Miss Lucas,
who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an
establishment, cared not how soon that establishment were gained.
Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent; and
it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity. Mr. Collins’s present
circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom they
could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly
fair. Lady Lucas began directly to calculate, with more interest than the matter
had ever excited before, how many years longer Mr. Bennet was likely to live;
and Sir William gave it as his decided opinion, that whenever Mr. Collins
should be in possession of the Longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient
that both he and his wife should make their appearance at St. James’s. The
whole family, in short, were properly overjoyed on the occasion. The younger
girls formed hopes of coming out a year or two sooner than they might
otherwise have done; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of
Charlotte’s dying an old maid. Charlotte herself was tolerably composed. She
had gained her point, and had time to consider of it. Her reflections were in
general satisfactory. Mr. Collins, to be sure, was neither sensible nor
agreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must be
imaginary. But still he would be her husband. Without thinking highly either
of men or matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it was the only
provision for well-educated young women of small fortune, and however
uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest preservative from
want. This preservative she had now obtained; and at the age of twenty-seven,
without having ever been handsome, she felt all the good luck of it. The least
agreeable circumstance in the business was the surprise it must occasion to
Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other
person. Elizabeth would wonder, and probably would blame her; and though
her resolution was not to be shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such a
disapprobation. She resolved to give her the information herself, and therefore
charged Mr. Collins, when he returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint
of what had passed before any of the family. A promise of secrecy was of
course very dutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the
curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct questions
on his return as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was at the same time
exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to publish his prosperous love.
As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the
family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved
for the night; and Mrs. Bennet, with great politeness and cordiality, said how
happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again, whenever his
engagements might allow him to visit them.
“My dear madam,” he replied, “this invitation is particularly gratifying,
because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and you may be very certain
that I shall avail myself of it as soon as possible.”
They were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by no means wish
for so speedy a return, immediately said:
“But is there not danger of Lady Catherine’s disapprobation here, my good
sir? You had better neglect your relations than run the risk of offending your
patroness.”
“My dear sir,” replied Mr. Collins, “I am particularly obliged to you for
this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so material a
step without her ladyship’s concurrence.”
“You cannot be too much upon your guard. Risk anything rather than her
displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again,
which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home, and be
satisfied that we shall take no offence.”
“Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such
affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily receive from me a
letter of thanks for this, and for every other mark of your regard during my
stay in Hertfordshire. As for my fair cousins, though my absence may not be
long enough to render it necessary, I shall now take the liberty of wishing
them health and happiness, not excepting my cousin Elizabeth.”
With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally
surprised that he meditated a quick return. Mrs. Bennet wished to understand
by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls, and
Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him. She rated his abilities much
higher than any of the others; there was a solidity in his reflections which
often struck her, and though by no means so clever as herself, she thought that
if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as hers, he
might become a very agreeable companion. But on the following morning,
every hope of this kind was done away. Miss Lucas called soon after
breakfast, and in a private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the
day before.
The possibility of Mr. Collins’s fancying himself in love with her friend
had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two; but that Charlotte
could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibility as she could
encourage him herself, and her astonishment was consequently so great as to
overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and she could not help crying out:
“Engaged to Mr. Collins! My dear Charlotte—impossible!”
The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her
story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a
reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon regained her
composure, and calmly replied:
“Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza? Do you think it incredible
that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman’s good opinion, because
he was not so happy as to succeed with you?”
But Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort for
it, was able to assure with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their
relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished her all imaginable
happiness.
“I see what you are feeling,” replied Charlotte. “You must be surprised,
very much surprised—so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry you. But
when you have had time to think it over, I hope you will be satisfied with what
I have done. I am not romantic, you know; I never was. I ask only a
comfortable home; and considering Mr. Collins’s character, connection, and
situation in life, I am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as
fair as most people can boast on entering the marriage state.”
Elizabeth quietly answered “Undoubtedly;” and after an awkward pause,
they returned to the rest of the family. Charlotte did not stay much longer, and
Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard. It was a long time
before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match. The
strangeness of Mr. Collins’s making two offers of marriage within three days
was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted. She had always felt that
Charlotte’s opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own, but she had
not supposed it to be possible that, when called into action, she would have
sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage. Charlotte the wife of Mr.
Collins was a most humiliating picture! And to the pang of a friend disgracing
herself and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction that it
was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen.
Chapter 23
Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what she
had heard, and doubting whether she was authorised to mention it, when Sir
William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter, to announce her
engagement to the family. With many compliments to them, and much selfgratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses, he unfolded
the matter—to an audience not merely wondering, but incredulous; for Mrs.
Bennet, with more perseverance than politeness, protested he must be entirely
mistaken; and Lydia, always unguarded and often uncivil, boisterously
exclaimed:
“Good Lord! Sir William, how can you tell such a story? Do not you know
that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?”
Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without
anger such treatment; but Sir William’s good breeding carried him through it
all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his
information, he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing
courtesy.
Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a
situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by mentioning her
prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself; and endeavoured to put a stop to
the exclamations of her mother and sisters by the earnestness of her
congratulations to Sir William, in which she was readily joined by Jane, and
by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from
the match, the excellent character of Mr. Collins, and the convenient distance
of Hunsford from London.
Mrs. Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while
Sir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a
rapid vent. In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the
matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr. Collins had been taken in; thirdly,
she trusted that they would never be happy together; and fourthly, that the
match might be broken off. Two inferences, however, were plainly deduced
from the whole: one, that Elizabeth was the real cause of the mischief; and the
other that she herself had been barbarously misused by them all; and on these
two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day. Nothing could
console and nothing could appease her. Nor did that day wear out her
resentment. A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without scolding
her, a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William or Lady Lucas
without being rude, and many months were gone before she could at all
forgive their daughter.
Mr. Bennet’s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such
as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for it
gratified him, he said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he had been
used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and more foolish
than his daughter!
Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she said less of
her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness; nor could
Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable. Kitty and Lydia were far
from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr. Collins was only a clergyman; and it
affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at Meryton.
Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on
Mrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she called at
Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was, though Mrs.
Bennet’s sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been enough to drive
happiness away.
Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them
mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no real
confidence could ever subsist between them again. Her disappointment in
Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister, of whose rectitude
and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken, and for whose
happiness she grew daily more anxious, as Bingley had now been gone a week
and nothing more was heard of his return.
Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting the
days till she might reasonably hope to hear again. The promised letter of
thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on Tuesday, addressed to their father, and
written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth’s abode in the
family might have prompted. After discharging his conscience on that head, he
proceeded to inform them, with many rapturous expressions, of his happiness
in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and
then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he
had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at
Longbourn, whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight; for
Lady Catherine, he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that she wished
it to take place as soon as possible, which he trusted would be an
unanswerable argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for
making him the happiest of men.
Mr. Collins’s return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure
to Mrs. Bennet. On the contrary, she was as much disposed to complain of it as
her husband. It was very strange that he should come to Longbourn instead of
to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome.
She hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent, and
lovers were of all people the most disagreeable. Such were the gentle murmurs
of Mrs. Bennet, and they gave way only to the greater distress of Mr.
Bingley’s continued absence.
Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject. Day after day
passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which
shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to Netherfield the whole
winter; a report which highly incensed Mrs. Bennet, and which she never
failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood.
Even Elizabeth began to fear—not that Bingley was indifferent—but that
his sisters would be successful in keeping him away. Unwilling as she was to
admit an idea so destructive of Jane’s happiness, and so dishonorable to the
stability of her lover, she could not prevent its frequently occurring. The
united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend,
assisted by the attractions of Miss Darcy and the amusements of London might
be too much, she feared, for the strength of his attachment.
As for Jane, her anxiety under this suspense was, of course, more painful
than Elizabeth’s, but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing, and
between herself and Elizabeth, therefore, the subject was never alluded to. But
as no such delicacy restrained her mother, an hour seldom passed in which she
did not talk of Bingley, express her impatience for his arrival, or even require
Jane to confess that if he did not come back she would think herself very ill
used. It needed all Jane’s steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable
tranquillity.
Mr. Collins returned most punctually on Monday fortnight, but his
reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first
introduction. He was too happy, however, to need much attention; and luckily
for the others, the business of love-making relieved them from a great deal of
his company. The chief of every day was spent by him at Lucas Lodge, and he
sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time to make an apology for his
absence before the family went to bed.
Mrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state. The very mention of
anything concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill-humour, and
wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of. The sight of Miss
Lucas was odious to her. As her successor in that house, she regarded her with
jealous abhorrence. Whenever Charlotte came to see them, she concluded her
to be anticipating the hour of possession; and whenever she spoke in a low
voice to Mr. Collins, was convinced that they were talking of the Longbourn
estate, and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house, as soon
as Mr. Bennet were dead. She complained bitterly of all this to her husband.
“Indeed, Mr. Bennet,” said she, “it is very hard to think that Charlotte
Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that I should be forced to make
way for her, and live to see her take her place in it!”
“My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope for better
things. Let us flatter ourselves that I may be the survivor.”
This was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet, and therefore, instead of
making any answer, she went on as before.
“I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate. If it was not for
the entail, I should not mind it.”
“What should not you mind?”
“I should not mind anything at all.”
“Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such
insensibility.”
“I never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for anything about the entail. How
anyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one’s own
daughters, I cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr. Collins too! Why
should he have it more than anybody else?”
“I leave it to yourself to determine,” said Mr. Bennet.
Chapter 24
Miss Bingley’s letter arrived, and put an end to doubt. The very first
sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for the
winter, and concluded with her brother’s regret at not having had time to pay
his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left the country.
Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the rest of the
letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the writer, that could
give her any comfort. Miss Darcy’s praise occupied the chief of it. Her many
attractions were again dwelt on, and Caroline boasted joyfully of their
increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes
which had been unfolded in her former letter. She wrote also with great
pleasure of her brother’s being an inmate of Mr. Darcy’s house, and mentioned
with raptures some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture.
Elizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this,
heard it in silent indignation. Her heart was divided between concern for her
sister, and resentment against all others. To Caroline’s assertion of her
brother’s being partial to Miss Darcy she paid no credit. That he was really
fond of Jane, she doubted no more than she had ever done; and much as she
had always been disposed to like him, she could not think without anger,
hardly without contempt, on that easiness of temper, that want of proper
resolution, which now made him the slave of his designing friends, and led
him to sacrifice of his own happiness to the caprice of their inclination. Had
his own happiness, however, been the only sacrifice, he might have been
allowed to sport with it in whatever manner he thought best, but her sister’s
was involved in it, as she thought he must be sensible himself. It was a subject,
in short, on which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing.
She could think of nothing else; and yet whether Bingley’s regard had really
died away, or were suppressed by his friends’ interference; whether he had
been aware of Jane’s attachment, or whether it had escaped his observation;
whatever were the case, though her opinion of him must be materially affected
by the difference, her sister’s situation remained the same, her peace equally
wounded.
A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to
Elizabeth; but at last, on Mrs. Bennet’s leaving them together, after a longer
irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master, she could not help
saying:
“Oh, that my dear mother had more command over herself! She can have
no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him. But I will
not repine. It cannot last long. He will be forgot, and we shall all be as we
were before.”
Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said nothing.
“You doubt me,” cried Jane, slightly colouring; “indeed, you have no
reason. He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my
acquaintance, but that is all. I have nothing either to hope or fear, and nothing
to reproach him with. Thank God! I have not that pain. A little time, therefore
—I shall certainly try to get the better.”
With a stronger voice she soon added, “I have this comfort immediately,
that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it has
done no harm to anyone but myself.”
“My dear Jane!” exclaimed Elizabeth, “you are too good. Your sweetness
and disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what to say to you. I
feel as if I had never done you justice, or loved you as you deserve.”
Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back the
praise on her sister’s warm affection.
“Nay,” said Elizabeth, “this is not fair. You wish to think all the world
respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody. I only want to think you
perfect, and you set yourself against it. Do not be afraid of my running into
any excess, of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good-will. You
need not. There are few people whom I really love, and still fewer of whom I
think well. The more I see of the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and
every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and
of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or sense.
I have met with two instances lately, one I will not mention; the other is
Charlotte’s marriage. It is unaccountable! In every view it is unaccountable!”
“My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these. They will ruin
your happiness. You do not make allowance enough for difference of situation
and temper. Consider Mr. Collins’s respectability, and Charlotte’s steady,
prudent character. Remember that she is one of a large family; that as to
fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be ready to believe, for everybody’s
sake, that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin.”
“To oblige you, I would try to believe almost anything, but no one else
could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that Charlotte
had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her understanding than I
now do of her heart. My dear Jane, Mr. Collins is a conceited, pompous,
narrow-minded, silly man; you know he is, as well as I do; and you must feel,
as well as I do, that the woman who married him cannot have a proper way of
thinking. You shall not defend her, though it is Charlotte Lucas. You shall not,
for the sake of one individual, change the meaning of principle and integrity,
nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and
insensibility of danger security for happiness.”
“I must think your language too strong in speaking of both,” replied Jane;
“and I hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them happy together. But
enough of this. You alluded to something else. You mentioned two instances. I
cannot misunderstand you, but I entreat you, dear Lizzy, not to pain me by
thinking that person to blame, and saying your opinion of him is sunk. We
must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured. We must not
expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect. It is very
often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us. Women fancy admiration
means more than it does.”
“And men take care that they should.”
“If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no idea of
there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine.”
“I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley’s conduct to design,”
said Elizabeth; “but without scheming to do wrong, or to make others
unhappy, there may be error, and there may be misery. Thoughtlessness, want
of attention to other people’s feelings, and want of resolution, will do the
business.”
“And do you impute it to either of those?”
“Yes; to the last. But if I go on, I shall displease you by saying what I think
of persons you esteem. Stop me whilst you can.”
“You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him?”
“Yes, in conjunction with his friend.”
“I cannot believe it. Why should they try to influence him? They can only
wish his happiness; and if he is attached to me, no other woman can secure it.”
“Your first position is false. They may wish many things besides his
happiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they may
wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great
connections, and pride.”
“Beyond a doubt, they do wish him to choose Miss Darcy,” replied Jane;
“but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing. They have
known her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love her
better. But, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely they should
have opposed their brother’s. What sister would think herself at liberty to do
it, unless there were something very objectionable? If they believed him
attached to me, they would not try to part us; if he were so, they could not
succeed. By supposing such an affection, you make everybody acting
unnaturally and wrong, and me most unhappy. Do not distress me by the idea.
I am not ashamed of having been mistaken—or, at least, it is light, it is nothing
in comparison of what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters. Let me
take it in the best light, in the light in which it may be understood.”
Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr. Bingley’s
name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.
Mrs. Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more,
and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account for it
clearly, there was little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity.
Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself,
that his attentions to Jane had been merely the effect of a common and
transient liking, which ceased when he saw her no more; but though the
probability of the statement was admitted at the time, she had the same story
to repeat every day. Mrs. Bennet’s best comfort was that Mr. Bingley must be
down again in the summer.
Mr. Bennet treated the matter differently. “So, Lizzy,” said he one day,
“your sister is crossed in love, I find. I congratulate her. Next to being married,
a girl likes to be crossed a little in love now and then. It is something to think
of, and it gives her a sort of distinction among her companions. When is your
turn to come? You will hardly bear to be long outdone by Jane. Now is your
time. Here are officers enough in Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in
the country. Let Wickham be your man. He is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt
you creditably.”
“Thank you, sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me. We must not
all expect Jane’s good fortune.”
“True,” said Mr. Bennet, “but it is a comfort to think that whatever of that
kind may befall you, you have an affectionate mother who will make the most
of it.”
Mr. Wickham’s society was of material service in dispelling the gloom
which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn
family. They saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now added
that of general unreserve. The whole of what Elizabeth had already heard, his
claims on Mr. Darcy, and all that he had suffered from him, was now openly
acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and everybody was pleased to know
how much they had always disliked Mr. Darcy before they had known
anything of the matter.
Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any
extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the society of
Hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances,
and urged the possibility of mistakes—but by everybody else Mr. Darcy was
condemned as the worst of men.
Chapter 25
After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity, Mr.
Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of Saturday. The
pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his side, by preparations
for the reception of his bride; as he had reason to hope, that shortly after his
return into Hertfordshire, the day would be fixed that was to make him the
happiest of men. He took leave of his relations at Longbourn with as much
solemnity as before; wished his fair cousins health and happiness again, and
promised their father another letter of thanks.
On the following Monday, Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of receiving her
brother and his wife, who came as usual to spend the Christmas at Longbourn.
Mr. Gardiner was a sensible, gentlemanlike man, greatly superior to his sister,
as well by nature as education. The Netherfield ladies would have had
difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade, and within view of his
own warehouses, could have been so well-bred and agreeable. Mrs. Gardiner,
who was several years younger than Mrs. Bennet and Mrs. Phillips, was an
amiable, intelligent, elegant woman, and a great favourite with all her
Longbourn nieces. Between the two eldest and herself especially, there
subsisted a particular regard. They had frequently been staying with her in
town.
The first part of Mrs. Gardiner’s business on her arrival was to distribute
her presents and describe the newest fashions. When this was done she had a
less active part to play. It became her turn to listen. Mrs. Bennet had many
grievances to relate, and much to complain of. They had all been very ill-used
since she last saw her sister. Two of her girls had been upon the point of
marriage, and after all there was nothing in it.
“I do not blame Jane,” she continued, “for Jane would have got Mr.
Bingley if she could. But Lizzy! Oh, sister! It is very hard to think that she
might have been Mr. Collins’s wife by this time, had it not been for her own
perverseness. He made her an offer in this very room, and she refused him.
The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have a daughter married before
I have, and that the Longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever. The
Lucases are very artful people indeed, sister. They are all for what they can
get. I am sorry to say it of them, but so it is. It makes me very nervous and
poorly, to be thwarted so in my own family, and to have neighbours who think
of themselves before anybody else. However, your coming just at this time is
the greatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us, of long
sleeves.”
Mrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before, in
the course of Jane and Elizabeth’s correspondence with her, made her sister a
slight answer, and, in compassion to her nieces, turned the conversation.
When alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject. “It
seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane,” said she. “I am sorry it
went off. But these things happen so often! A young man, such as you describe
Mr. Bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks, and
when accident separates them, so easily forgets her, that these sort of
inconsistencies are very frequent.”
“An excellent consolation in its way,” said Elizabeth, “but it will not do for
us. We do not suffer by accident. It does not often happen that the interference
of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more
of a girl whom he was violently in love with only a few days before.”
“But that expression of ‘violently in love’ is so hackneyed, so doubtful, so
indefinite, that it gives me very little idea. It is as often applied to feelings
which arise from a half-hour’s acquaintance, as to a real, strong attachment.
Pray, how violent was Mr. Bingley’s love?”
“I never saw a more promising inclination; he was growing quite
inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her. Every time they met,
it was more decided and remarkable. At his own ball he offended two or three
young ladies, by not asking them to dance; and I spoke to him twice myself,
without receiving an answer. Could there be finer symptoms? Is not general
incivility the very essence of love?”
“Oh, yes!—of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt. Poor
Jane! I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get over it
immediately. It had better have happened to you, Lizzy; you would have
laughed yourself out of it sooner. But do you think she would be prevailed
upon to go back with us? Change of scene might be of service—and perhaps a
little relief from home may be as useful as anything.”
Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded
of her sister’s ready acquiescence.
“I hope,” added Mrs. Gardiner, “that no consideration with regard to this
young man will influence her. We live in so different a part of town, all our
connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go out so little, that it
is very improbable that they should meet at all, unless he really comes to see
her.”
“And that is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his friend,
and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a part of
London! My dear aunt, how could you think of it? Mr. Darcy may perhaps
have heard of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he would hardly think a
month’s ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities, were he once to
enter it; and depend upon it, Mr. Bingley never stirs without him.”
“So much the better. I hope they will not meet at all. But does not Jane
correspond with his sister? She will not be able to help calling.”
“She will drop the acquaintance entirely.”
But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this point,
as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley’s being withheld from
seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her, on
examination, that she did not consider it entirely hopeless. It was possible, and
sometimes she thought it probable, that his affection might be reanimated, and
the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural
influence of Jane’s attractions.
Miss Bennet accepted her aunt’s invitation with pleasure; and the Bingleys
were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time, than as she hoped by
Caroline’s not living in the same house with her brother, she might
occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger of seeing him.
The Gardiners stayed a week at Longbourn; and what with the Phillipses,
the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its engagement. Mrs.
Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and
sister, that they did not once sit down to a family dinner. When the
engagement was for home, some of the officers always made part of it—of
which officers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one; and on these occasions, Mrs.
Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth’s warm commendation, narrowly
observed them both. Without supposing them, from what she saw, to be very
seriously in love, their preference of each other was plain enough to make her
a little uneasy; and she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she
left Hertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an
attachment.
To Mrs. Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure,
unconnected with his general powers. About ten or a dozen years ago, before
her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that very part of Derbyshire
to which he belonged. They had, therefore, many acquaintances in common;
and though Wickham had been little there since the death of Darcy’s father, it
was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends than
she had been in the way of procuring.
Mrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late Mr. Darcy by
character perfectly well. Here consequently was an inexhaustible subject of
discourse. In comparing her recollection of Pemberley with the minute
description which Wickham could give, and in bestowing her tribute of praise
on the character of its late possessor, she was delighting both him and herself.
On being made acquainted with the present Mr. Darcy’s treatment of him, she
tried to remember some of that gentleman’s reputed disposition when quite a
lad which might agree with it, and was confident at last that she recollected
having heard Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud, illnatured boy.
Chapter 26
Mrs. Gardiner’s caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on
the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone; after honestly telling
her what she thought, she thus went on:
“You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely because you are
warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of speaking openly. Seriously,
I would have you be on your guard. Do not involve yourself or endeavour to
involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very
imprudent. I have nothing to say against him; he is a most interesting young
man; and if he had the fortune he ought to have, I should think you could not
do better. But as it is, you must not let your fancy run away with you. You
have sense, and we all expect you to use it. Your father would depend on your
resolution and good conduct, I am sure. You must not disappoint your father.”
“My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed.”
“Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise.”
“Well, then, you need not be under any alarm. I will take care of myself,
and of Mr. Wickham too. He shall not be in love with me, if I can prevent it.”
“Elizabeth, you are not serious now.”
“I beg your pardon, I will try again. At present I am not in love with Mr.
Wickham; no, I certainly am not. But he is, beyond all comparison, the most
agreeable man I ever saw—and if he becomes really attached to me—I believe
it will be better that he should not. I see the imprudence of it. Oh! that
abominable Mr. Darcy! My father’s opinion of me does me the greatest
honour, and I should be miserable to forfeit it. My father, however, is partial to
Mr. Wickham. In short, my dear aunt, I should be very sorry to be the means
of making any of you unhappy; but since we see every day that where there is
affection, young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune
from entering into engagements with each other, how can I promise to be
wiser than so many of my fellow-creatures if I am tempted, or how am I even
to know that it would be wisdom to resist? All that I can promise you,
therefore, is not to be in a hurry. I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his
first object. When I am in company with him, I will not be wishing. In short, I
will do my best.”
“Perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very often.
At least, you should not remind your mother of inviting him.”
“As I did the other day,” said Elizabeth with a conscious smile: “very true,
it will be wise in me to refrain from that. But do not imagine that he is always
here so often. It is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this
week. You know my mother’s ideas as to the necessity of constant company
for her friends. But really, and upon my honour, I will try to do what I think to
be the wisest; and now I hope you are satisfied.”
Her aunt assured her that she was, and Elizabeth having thanked her for the
kindness of her hints, they parted; a wonderful instance of advice being given
on such a point, without being resented.
Mr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the
Gardiners and Jane; but as he took up his abode with the Lucases, his arrival
was no great inconvenience to Mrs. Bennet. His marriage was now fast
approaching, and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable, and
even repeatedly to say, in an ill-natured tone, that she “wished they might be
happy.” Thursday was to be the wedding day, and on Wednesday Miss Lucas
paid her farewell visit; and when she rose to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of
her mother’s ungracious and reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected
herself, accompanied her out of the room. As they went downstairs together,
Charlotte said:
“I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza.”
“That you certainly shall.”
“And I have another favour to ask you. Will you come and see me?”
“We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire.”
“I am not likely to leave Kent for some time. Promise me, therefore, to
come to Hunsford.”
Elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit.
“My father and Maria are coming to me in March,” added Charlotte, “and I
hope you will consent to be of the party. Indeed, Eliza, you will be as welcome
as either of them.”
The wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from
the church door, and everybody had as much to say, or to hear, on the subject
as usual. Elizabeth soon heard from her friend; and their correspondence was
as regular and frequent as it had ever been; that it should be equally
unreserved was impossible. Elizabeth could never address her without feeling
that all the comfort of intimacy was over, and though determined not to
slacken as a correspondent, it was for the sake of what had been, rather than
what was. Charlotte’s first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness;
there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new
home, how she would like Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare
pronounce herself to be; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that
Charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen.
She wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned
nothing which she could not praise. The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and
roads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine’s behaviour was most friendly
and obliging. It was Mr. Collins’s picture of Hunsford and Rosings rationally
softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there to
know the rest.
Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe
arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth hoped it would be in
her power to say something of the Bingleys.
Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience
generally is. Jane had been a week in town without either seeing or hearing
from Caroline. She accounted for it, however, by supposing that her last letter
to her friend from Longbourn had by some accident been lost.
“My aunt,” she continued, “is going to-morrow into that part of the town,
and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor Street.”
She wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss Bingley. “I
did not think Caroline in spirits,” were her words, “but she was very glad to
see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to London.
I was right, therefore, my last letter had never reached her. I inquired after
their brother, of course. He was well, but so much engaged with Mr. Darcy
that they scarcely ever saw him. I found that Miss Darcy was expected to
dinner. I wish I could see her. My visit was not long, as Caroline and Mrs.
Hurst were going out. I dare say I shall see them soon here.”
Elizabeth shook her head over this letter. It convinced her that accident
only could discover to Mr. Bingley her sister’s being in town.
Four weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him. She endeavoured
to persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be blind
to Miss Bingley’s inattention. After waiting at home every morning for a
fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the visitor did at
last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more, the alteration of her
manner would allow Jane to deceive herself no longer. The letter which she
wrote on this occasion to her sister will prove what she felt.
“My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in her better
judgement, at my expense, when I confess myself to have been entirely
deceived in Miss Bingley’s regard for me. But, my dear sister, though the
event has proved you right, do not think me obstinate if I still assert that,
considering what her behaviour was, my confidence was as natural as your
suspicion. I do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate
with me; but if the same circumstances were to happen again, I am sure I
should be deceived again. Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday; and
not a note, not a line, did I receive in the meantime. When she did come, it
was very evident that she had no pleasure in it; she made a slight, formal
apology, for not calling before, said not a word of wishing to see me again,
and was in every respect so altered a creature, that when she went away I was
perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer. I pity, though I
cannot help blaming her. She was very wrong in singling me out as she did; I
can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on her side. But I pity her,
because she must feel that she has been acting wrong, and because I am very
sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it. I need not explain myself
farther; and though we know this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she feels
it, it will easily account for her behaviour to me; and so deservedly dear as he
is to his sister, whatever anxiety she must feel on his behalf is natural and
amiable. I cannot but wonder, however, at her having any such fears now,
because, if he had at all cared about me, we must have met, long ago. He
knows of my being in town, I am certain, from something she said herself; and
yet it would seem, by her manner of talking, as if she wanted to persuade
herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy. I cannot understand it. If I were
not afraid of judging harshly, I should be almost tempted to say that there is a
strong appearance of duplicity in all this. But I will endeavour to banish every
painful thought, and think only of what will make me happy—your affection,
and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt. Let me hear from you
very soon. Miss Bingley said something of his never returning to Netherfield
again, of giving up the house, but not with any certainty. We had better not
mention it. I am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our
friends at Hunsford. Pray go to see them, with Sir William and Maria. I am
sure you will be very comfortable there.—Yours, etc.”
This letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as she
considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least. All
expectation from the brother was now absolutely over. She would not even
wish for a renewal of his attentions. His character sunk on every review of it;
and as a punishment for him, as well as a possible advantage to Jane, she
seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr. Darcy’s sister, as by
Wickham’s account, she would make him abundantly regret what he had
thrown away.
Mrs. Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise
concerning that gentleman, and required information; and Elizabeth had such
to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself. His
apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over, he was the admirer
of some one else. Elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all, but she could
see it and write of it without material pain. Her heart had been but slightly
touched, and her vanity was satisfied with believing that she would have been
his only choice, had fortune permitted it. The sudden acquisition of ten
thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady to whom
he was now rendering himself agreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted
perhaps in this case than in Charlotte’s, did not quarrel with him for his wish
of independence. Nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and while
able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was ready
to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very sincerely
wish him happy.
All this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner; and after relating the
circumstances, she thus went on: “I am now convinced, my dear aunt, that I
have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that pure and
elevating passion, I should at present detest his very name, and wish him all
manner of evil. But my feelings are not only cordial towards him; they are
even impartial towards Miss King. I cannot find out that I hate her at all, or
that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl. There can
be no love in all this. My watchfulness has been effectual; and though I
certainly should be a more interesting object to all my acquaintances were I
distractedly in love with him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative
insignificance. Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly. Kitty and
Lydia take his defection much more to heart than I do. They are young in the
ways of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that
handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plain.”
Chapter 27
With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and otherwise
diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton, sometimes dirty and
sometimes cold, did January and February pass away. March was to take
Elizabeth to Hunsford. She had not at first thought very seriously of going
thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan and she
gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater
certainty. Absence had increased her desire of seeing Charlotte again, and
weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins. There was novelty in the scheme, and as,
with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters, home could not be
faultless, a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake. The journey
would moreover give her a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near,
she would have been very sorry for any delay. Everything, however, went on
smoothly, and was finally settled according to Charlotte’s first sketch. She was
to accompany Sir William and his second daughter. The improvement of
spending a night in London was added in time, and the plan became perfect as
plan could be.
The only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her, and
who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he told her to
write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter.
The farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly friendly; on
his side even more. His present pursuit could not make him forget that
Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the first to
listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner of bidding her
adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what she was to expect
in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their opinion of her—their opinion
of everybody—would always coincide, there was a solicitude, an interest
which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard; and she
parted from him convinced that, whether married or single, he must always be
her model of the amiable and pleasing.
Her fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her think him
less agreeable. Sir William Lucas, and his daughter Maria, a good-humoured
girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to say that could be worth
hearing, and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the
chaise. Elizabeth loved absurdities, but she had known Sir William’s too long.
He could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and
knighthood; and his civilities were worn out, like his information.
It was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early as to
be in Gracechurch Street by noon. As they drove to Mr. Gardiner’s door, Jane
was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival; when they entered the
passage she was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth, looking earnestly in
her face, was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever. On the stairs were a
troop of little boys and girls, whose eagerness for their cousin’s appearance
would not allow them to wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as
they had not seen her for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower. All
was joy and kindness. The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in
bustle and shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.
Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt. Their first object was her sister;
and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to her minute
inquiries, that though Jane always struggled to support her spirits, there were
periods of dejection. It was reasonable, however, to hope that they would not
continue long. Mrs. Gardiner gave her the particulars also of Miss Bingley’s
visit in Gracechurch Street, and repeated conversations occurring at different
times between Jane and herself, which proved that the former had, from her
heart, given up the acquaintance.
Mrs. Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham’s desertion, and
complimented her on bearing it so well.
“But my dear Elizabeth,” she added, “what sort of girl is Miss King? I
should be sorry to think our friend mercenary.”
“Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs, between
the mercenary and the prudent motive? Where does discretion end, and avarice
begin? Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me, because it would
be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to get a girl with only ten
thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is mercenary.”
“If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall know what
to think.”
“She is a very good kind of girl, I believe. I know no harm of her.”
“But he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather’s death made
her mistress of this fortune.”
“No—why should he? If it were not allowable for him to gain my
affections because I had no money, what occasion could there be for making
love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally poor?”
“But there seems an indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her so
soon after this event.”
“A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant
decorums which other people may observe. If she does not object to it, why
should we?”
“Her not objecting does not justify him. It only shows her being deficient
in something herself—sense or feeling.”
“Well,” cried Elizabeth, “have it as you choose. He shall be mercenary, and
she shall be foolish.”
“No, Lizzy, that is what I do not choose. I should be sorry, you know, to
think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire.”
“Oh! if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in
Derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not much
better. I am sick of them all. Thank Heaven! I am going to-morrow where I
shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who has neither manner
nor sense to recommend him. Stupid men are the only ones worth knowing,
after all.”
“Take care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment.”
Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had the
unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a
tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer.
“We have not determined how far it shall carry us,” said Mrs. Gardiner,
“but, perhaps, to the Lakes.”
No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and her
acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful. “Oh, my dear, dear
aunt,” she rapturously cried, “what delight! what felicity! You give me fresh
life and vigour. Adieu to disappointment and spleen. What are young men to
rocks and mountains? Oh! what hours of transport we shall spend! And when
we do return, it shall not be like other travellers, without being able to give
one accurate idea of anything. We will know where we have gone—we will
recollect what we have seen. Lakes, mountains, and rivers shall not be
jumbled together in our imaginations; nor when we attempt to describe any
particular scene, will we begin quarreling about its relative situation. Let our
first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers.”
Chapter 28
Every object in the next day’s journey was new and interesting to
Elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment; for she had seen her
sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health, and the prospect of
her northern tour was a constant source of delight.
When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was in
search of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view. The
palings of Rosings Park was their boundary on one side. Elizabeth smiled at
the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.
At length the Parsonage was discernible. The garden sloping to the road,
the house standing in it, the green pales, and the laurel hedge, everything
declared they were arriving. Mr. Collins and Charlotte appeared at the door,
and the carriage stopped at the small gate which led by a short gravel walk to
the house, amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party. In a moment they
were all out of the chaise, rejoicing at the sight of each other. Mrs. Collins
welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and
more satisfied with coming when she found herself so affectionately received.
She saw instantly that her cousin’s manners were not altered by his marriage;
his formal civility was just what it had been, and he detained her some minutes
at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all her family. They were then,
with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance, taken
into the house; and as soon as they were in the parlour, he welcomed them a
second time, with ostentatious formality to his humble abode, and punctually
repeated all his wife’s offers of refreshment.
Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help in
fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its aspect and its
furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her, as if wishing to make her
feel what she had lost in refusing him. But though everything seemed neat and
comfortable, she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance, and
rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air
with such a companion. When Mr. Collins said anything of which his wife
might reasonably be ashamed, which certainly was not unseldom, she
involuntarily turned her eye on Charlotte. Once or twice she could discern a
faint blush; but in general Charlotte wisely did not hear. After sitting long
enough to admire every article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to
the fender, to give an account of their journey, and of all that had happened in
London, Mr. Collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden, which was
large and well laid out, and to the cultivation of which he attended himself. To
work in this garden was one of his most respectable pleasures; and Elizabeth
admired the command of countenance with which Charlotte talked of the
healthfulness of the exercise, and owned she encouraged it as much as
possible. Here, leading the way through every walk and cross walk, and
scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for, every view
was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind. He could
number the fields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were
in the most distant clump. But of all the views which his garden, or which the
country or kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with the prospect
of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly
opposite the front of his house. It was a handsome modern building, well
situated on rising ground.
From his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his two
meadows; but the ladies, not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white
frost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied him, Charlotte took her
sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased, probably, to have the
opportunity of showing it without her husband’s help. It was rather small, but
well built and convenient; and everything was fitted up and arranged with a
neatness and consistency of which Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit.
When Mr. Collins could be forgotten, there was really an air of great comfort
throughout, and by Charlotte’s evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he
must be often forgotten.
She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country. It was
spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr. Collins joining in,
observed:
“Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine
de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you will be
delighted with her. She is all affability and condescension, and I doubt not but
you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over. I
have scarcely any hesitation in saying she will include you and my sister
Maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here.
Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming. We dine at Rosings twice
every week, and are never allowed to walk home. Her ladyship’s carriage is
regularly ordered for us. I should say, one of her ladyship’s carriages, for she
has several.”
“Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed,” added
Charlotte, “and a most attentive neighbour.”
“Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say. She is the sort of woman
whom one cannot regard with too much deference.”
The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news, and
telling again what had already been written; and when it closed, Elizabeth, in
the solitude of her chamber, had to meditate upon Charlotte’s degree of
contentment, to understand her address in guiding, and composure in bearing
with, her husband, and to acknowledge that it was all done very well. She had
also to anticipate how her visit would pass, the quiet tenor of their usual
employments, the vexatious interruptions of Mr. Collins, and the gaieties of
their intercourse with Rosings. A lively imagination soon settled it all.
About the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready for
a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion;
and, after listening a moment, she heard somebody running up stairs in a
violent hurry, and calling loudly after her. She opened the door and met Maria
in the landing place, who, breathless with agitation, cried out—
“Oh, my dear Eliza! pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for
there is such a sight to be seen! I will not tell you what it is. Make haste, and
come down this moment.”
Elizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing more, and
down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted the lane, in quest of this
wonder; It was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate.
“And is this all?” cried Elizabeth. “I expected at least that the pigs were got
into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her daughter.”
“La! my dear,” said Maria, quite shocked at the mistake, “it is not Lady
Catherine. The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives with them; the other is
Miss de Bourgh. Only look at her. She is quite a little creature. Who would
have thought that she could be so thin and small?”
“She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind.
Why does she not come in?”
“Oh, Charlotte says she hardly ever does. It is the greatest of favours when
Miss de Bourgh comes in.”
“I like her appearance,” said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas. “She looks
sickly and cross. Yes, she will do for him very well. She will make him a very
proper wife.”
Mr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation
with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth’s high diversion, was stationed
in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him, and
constantly bowing whenever Miss de Bourgh looked that way.
At length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and the
others returned into the house. Mr. Collins no sooner saw the two girls than he
began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which Charlotte explained
by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at Rosings the
next day.
Chapter 29
Mr. Collins’s triumph, in consequence of this invitation, was complete. The
power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors,
and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife, was exactly
what he had wished for; and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so
soon, was such an instance of Lady Catherine’s condescension, as he knew not
how to admire enough.
“I confess,” said he, “that I should not have been at all surprised by her
ladyship’s asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at Rosings.
I rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that it would happen.
But who could have foreseen such an attention as this? Who could have
imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there (an invitation,
moreover, including the whole party) so immediately after your arrival!”
“I am the less surprised at what has happened,” replied Sir William, “from
that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which my situation
in life has allowed me to acquire. About the court, such instances of elegant
breeding are not uncommon.”
Scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their
visit to Rosings. Mr. Collins was carefully instructing them in what they were
to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and so splendid a
dinner, might not wholly overpower them.
When the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to Elizabeth—
“Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel. Lady
Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which becomes
herself and her daughter. I would advise you merely to put on whatever of
your clothes is superior to the rest—there is no occasion for anything more.
Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed. She
likes to have the distinction of rank preserved.”
While they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different
doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine very much objected
to be kept waiting for her dinner. Such formidable accounts of her ladyship,
and her manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas who had been little
used to company, and she looked forward to her introduction at Rosings with
as much apprehension as her father had done to his presentation at St. James’s.
As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile
across the park. Every park has its beauty and its prospects; and Elizabeth saw
much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such raptures as Mr.
Collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but slightly affected by his
enumeration of the windows in front of the house, and his relation of what the
glazing altogether had originally cost Sir Lewis de Bourgh.
When they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria’s alarm was every moment
increasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm. Elizabeth’s
courage did not fail her. She had heard nothing of Lady Catherine that spoke
her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue, and the mere
stateliness of money or rank she thought she could witness without trepidation.
From the entrance-hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with a rapturous
air, the fine proportion and the finished ornaments, they followed the servants
through an ante-chamber, to the room where Lady Catherine, her daughter,
and Mrs. Jenkinson were sitting. Her ladyship, with great condescension, arose
to receive them; and as Mrs. Collins had settled it with her husband that the
office of introduction should be hers, it was performed in a proper manner,
without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought
necessary.
In spite of having been at St. James’s, Sir William was so completely awed
by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage enough to make
a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word; and his daughter,
frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge of her chair, not knowing
which way to look. Elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene, and could
observe the three ladies before her composedly. Lady Catherine was a tall,
large woman, with strongly-marked features, which might once have been
handsome. Her air was not conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them
such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank. She was not rendered
formidable by silence; but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a
tone, as marked her self-importance, and brought Mr. Wickham immediately
to Elizabeth’s mind; and from the observation of the day altogether, she
believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he represented.
When, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment
she soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy, she turned her eyes on the
daughter, she could almost have joined in Maria’s astonishment at her being so
thin and so small. There was neither in figure nor face any likeness between
the ladies. Miss de Bourgh was pale and sickly; her features, though not plain,
were insignificant; and she spoke very little, except in a low voice, to Mrs.
Jenkinson, in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable, and who was
entirely engaged in listening to what she said, and placing a screen in the
proper direction before her eyes.
After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows to
admire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to point out its beauties, and Lady
Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in
the summer.
The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants and
all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had promised; and, as he had
likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by her ladyship’s
desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater. He
carved, and ate, and praised with delighted alacrity; and every dish was
commended, first by him and then by Sir William, who was now enough
recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law said, in a manner which Elizabeth
wondered Lady Catherine could bear. But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by
their excessive admiration, and gave most gracious smiles, especially when
any dish on the table proved a novelty to them. The party did not supply much
conversation. Elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening,
but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss de Bourgh—the former of
whom was engaged in listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a
word to her all dinner-time. Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching
how little Miss de Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing
she was indisposed. Maria thought speaking out of the question, and the
gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.
When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to be done
but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any intermission till
coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a
manner, as proved that she was not used to have her judgement controverted.
She inquired into Charlotte’s domestic concerns familiarly and minutely, gave
her a great deal of advice as to the management of them all; told her how
everything ought to be regulated in so small a family as hers, and instructed
her as to the care of her cows and her poultry. Elizabeth found that nothing
was beneath this great lady’s attention, which could furnish her with an
occasion of dictating to others. In the intervals of her discourse with Mrs.
Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and Elizabeth, but
especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew the least, and who she
observed to Mrs. Collins was a very genteel, pretty kind of girl. She asked her,
at different times, how many sisters she had, whether they were older or
younger than herself, whether any of them were likely to be married, whether
they were handsome, where they had been educated, what carriage her father
kept, and what had been her mother’s maiden name? Elizabeth felt all the
impertinence of her questions but answered them very composedly. Lady
Catherine then observed,
“Your father’s estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think. For your sake,”
turning to Charlotte, “I am glad of it; but otherwise I see no occasion for
entailing estates from the female line. It was not thought necessary in Sir
Lewis de Bourgh’s family. Do you play and sing, Miss Bennet?”
“A little.”
“Oh! then—some time or other we shall be happy to hear you. Our
instrument is a capital one, probably superior to——You shall try it some day.
Do your sisters play and sing?”
“One of them does.”
“Why did not you all learn? You ought all to have learned. The Miss
Webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as yours. Do you
draw?”
“No, not at all.”
“What, none of you?”
“Not one.”
“That is very strange. But I suppose you had no opportunity. Your mother
should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters.”
“My mother would have had no objection, but my father hates London.”
“Has your governess left you?”
“We never had any governess.”
“No governess! How was that possible? Five daughters brought up at home
without a governess! I never heard of such a thing. Your mother must have
been quite a slave to your education.”
Elizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had not been
the case.
“Then, who taught you? who attended to you? Without a governess, you
must have been neglected.”
“Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us as
wished to learn never wanted the means. We were always encouraged to read,
and had all the masters that were necessary. Those who chose to be idle,
certainly might.”
“Aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if I had
known your mother, I should have advised her most strenuously to engage
one. I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and
regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it. It is wonderful
how many families I have been the means of supplying in that way. I am
always glad to get a young person well placed out. Four nieces of Mrs.
Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and it was but the
other day that I recommended another young person, who was merely
accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite delighted with her.
Mrs. Collins, did I tell you of Lady Metcalf’s calling yesterday to thank me?
She finds Miss Pope a treasure. ‘Lady Catherine,’ said she, ‘you have given
me a treasure.’ Are any of your younger sisters out, Miss Bennet?”
“Yes, ma’am, all.”
“All! What, all five out at once? Very odd! And you only the second. The
younger ones out before the elder ones are married! Your younger sisters must
be very young?”
“Yes, my youngest is not sixteen. Perhaps she is full young to be much in
company. But really, ma’am, I think it would be very hard upon younger
sisters, that they should not have their share of society and amusement,
because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early. The
last-born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth as the first. And to be
kept back on such a motive! I think it would not be very likely to promote
sisterly affection or delicacy of mind.”
“Upon my word,” said her ladyship, “you give your opinion very decidedly
for so young a person. Pray, what is your age?”
“With three younger sisters grown up,” replied Elizabeth, smiling, “your
ladyship can hardly expect me to own it.”
Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer;
and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to
trifle with so much dignified impertinence.
“You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure, therefore you need not
conceal your age.”
“I am not one-and-twenty.”
When the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card-tables
were placed. Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr. and Mrs. Collins sat down
to quadrille; and as Miss de Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the two girls had
the honour of assisting Mrs. Jenkinson to make up her party. Their table was
superlatively stupid. Scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the
game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson expressed her fears of Miss de Bourgh’s
being too hot or too cold, or having too much or too little light. A great deal
more passed at the other table. Lady Catherine was generally speaking—
stating the mistakes of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself.
Mr. Collins was employed in agreeing to everything her ladyship said,
thanking her for every fish he won, and apologising if he thought he won too
many. Sir William did not say much. He was storing his memory with
anecdotes and noble names.
When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose,
the tables were broken up, the carriage was offered to Mrs. Collins, gratefully
accepted and immediately ordered. The party then gathered round the fire to
hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were to have on the
morrow. From these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the
coach; and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr. Collins’s side and as
many bows on Sir William’s they departed. As soon as they had driven from
the door, Elizabeth was called on by her cousin to give her opinion of all that
she had seen at Rosings, which, for Charlotte’s sake, she made more
favourable than it really was. But her commendation, though costing her some
trouble, could by no means satisfy Mr. Collins, and he was very soon obliged
to take her ladyship’s praise into his own hands.
Chapter 30
Sir William stayed only a week at Hunsford, but his visit was long enough
to convince him of his daughter’s being most comfortably settled, and of her
possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with.
While Sir William was with them, Mr. Collins devoted his morning to driving
him out in his gig, and showing him the country; but when he went away, the
whole family returned to their usual employments, and Elizabeth was thankful
to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration, for the chief
of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at
work in the garden or in reading and writing, and looking out of the window in
his own book-room, which fronted the road. The room in which the ladies sat
was backwards. Elizabeth had at first rather wondered that Charlotte should
not prefer the dining-parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and
had a more pleasant aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent
reason for what she did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been much
less in his own apartment, had they sat in one equally lively; and she gave
Charlotte credit for the arrangement.
From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and
were indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along,
and how often especially Miss de Bourgh drove by in her phaeton, which he
never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened almost every day.
She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had a few minutes’
conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever prevailed upon to get out.
Very few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to Rosings, and
not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise; and till
Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed
of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours. Now and then
they were honoured with a call from her ladyship, and nothing escaped her
observation that was passing in the room during these visits. She examined
into their employments, looked at their work, and advised them to do it
differently; found fault with the arrangement of the furniture; or detected the
housemaid in negligence; and if she accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it
only for the sake of finding out that Mrs. Collins’s joints of meat were too
large for her family.
Elizabeth soon perceived, that though this great lady was not in
commission of the peace of the county, she was a most active magistrate in her
own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by Mr. Collins;
and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome,
discontented, or too poor, she sallied forth into the village to settle their
differences, silence their complaints, and scold them into harmony and plenty.
The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week;
and, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being only one card-table
in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first. Their
other engagements were few, as the style of living in the neighbourhood in
general was beyond Mr. Collins’s reach. This, however, was no evil to
Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough; there
were half-hours of pleasant conversation with Charlotte, and the weather was
so fine for the time of year that she had often great enjoyment out of doors.
Her favourite walk, and where she frequently went while the others were
calling on Lady Catherine, was along the open grove which edged that side of
the park, where there was a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value
but herself, and where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine’s curiosity.
In this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away. Easter
was approaching, and the week preceding it was to bring an addition to the
family at Rosings, which in so small a circle must be important. Elizabeth had
heard soon after her arrival that Mr. Darcy was expected there in the course of
a few weeks, and though there were not many of her acquaintances whom she
did not prefer, his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in
their Rosings parties, and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss
Bingley’s designs on him were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he
was evidently destined by Lady Catherine, who talked of his coming with the
greatest satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and
seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by Miss
Lucas and herself.
His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage; for Mr. Collins was walking
the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane, in
order to have the earliest assurance of it, and after making his bow as the
carriage turned into the Park, hurried home with the great intelligence. On the
following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects. There were two
nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for Mr. Darcy had brought with
him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of his uncle Lord ——, and, to the
great surprise of all the party, when Mr. Collins returned, the gentlemen
accompanied him. Charlotte had seen them from her husband’s room, crossing
the road, and immediately running into the other, told the girls what an honour
they might expect, adding:
“I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility. Mr. Darcy would never
have come so soon to wait upon me.”
Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment, before
their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly afterwards the
three gentlemen entered the room. Colonel Fitzwilliam, who led the way, was
about thirty, not handsome, but in person and address most truly the
gentleman. Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire
—paid his compliments, with his usual reserve, to Mrs. Collins, and whatever
might be his feelings toward her friend, met her with every appearance of
composure. Elizabeth merely curtseyed to him without saying a word.
Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness
and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but his cousin, after
having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to Mrs. Collins,
sat for some time without speaking to anybody. At length, however, his civility
was so far awakened as to inquire of Elizabeth after the health of her family.
She answered him in the usual way, and after a moment’s pause, added:
“My eldest sister has been in town these three months. Have you never
happened to see her there?”
She was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to see whether
he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the Bingleys
and Jane, and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he
had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet. The subject was pursued
no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away.
Chapter 31
Colonel Fitzwilliam’s manners were very much admired at the Parsonage,
and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasures of their
engagements at Rosings. It was some days, however, before they received any
invitation thither—for while there were visitors in the house, they could not be
necessary; and it was not till Easter-day, almost a week after the gentlemen’s
arrival, that they were honoured by such an attention, and then they were
merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening. For the last
week they had seen very little of Lady Catherine or her daughter. Colonel
Fitzwilliam had called at the Parsonage more than once during the time, but
Mr. Darcy they had seen only at church.
The invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they joined the
party in Lady Catherine’s drawing-room. Her ladyship received them civilly,
but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when
she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact, almost engrossed by her
nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy, much more than to any other
person in the room.
Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; anything was a
welcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs. Collins’s pretty friend had
moreover caught his fancy very much. He now seated himself by her, and
talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying at
home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so well
entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much spirit and
flow, as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself, as well as of Mr.
Darcy. His eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look
of curiosity; and that her ladyship, after a while, shared the feeling, was more
openly acknowledged, for she did not scruple to call out:
“What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam? What is it you are talking of?
What are you telling Miss Bennet? Let me hear what it is.”
“We are speaking of music, madam,” said he, when no longer able to avoid
a reply.
“Of music! Then pray speak aloud. It is of all subjects my delight. I must
have my share in the conversation if you are speaking of music. There are few
people in England, I suppose, who have more true enjoyment of music than
myself, or a better natural taste. If I had ever learnt, I should have been a great
proficient. And so would Anne, if her health had allowed her to apply. I am
confident that she would have performed delightfully. How does Georgiana
get on, Darcy?”
Mr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister’s proficiency.
“I am very glad to hear such a good account of her,” said Lady Catherine;
“and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel if she does not
practice a good deal.”
“I assure you, madam,” he replied, “that she does not need such advice.
She practises very constantly.”
“So much the better. It cannot be done too much; and when I next write to
her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account. I often tell young ladies
that no excellence in music is to be acquired without constant practice. I have
told Miss Bennet several times, that she will never play really well unless she
practises more; and though Mrs. Collins has no instrument, she is very
welcome, as I have often told her, to come to Rosings every day, and play on
the pianoforte in Mrs. Jenkinson’s room. She would be in nobody’s way, you
know, in that part of the house.”
Mr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt’s ill-breeding, and made no
answer.
When coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having
promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument. He drew
a chair near her. Lady Catherine listened to half a song, and then talked, as
before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away from her, and making
with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte stationed himself so as to
command a full view of the fair performer’s countenance. Elizabeth saw what
he was doing, and at the first convenient pause, turned to him with an arch
smile, and said:
“You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state to hear
me? I will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well. There is a
stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of
others. My courage always rises at every attempt to intimidate me.”
“I shall not say you are mistaken,” he replied, “because you could not
really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and I have had the
pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find great
enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your
own.”
Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to Colonel
Fitzwilliam, “Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me, and teach
you not to believe a word I say. I am particularly unlucky in meeting with a
person so able to expose my real character, in a part of the world where I had
hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit. Indeed, Mr. Darcy, it is
very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in
Hertfordshire—and, give me leave to say, very impolitic too—for it is
provoking me to retaliate, and such things may come out as will shock your
relations to hear.”
“I am not afraid of you,” said he, smilingly.
“Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of,” cried Colonel
Fitzwilliam. “I should like to know how he behaves among strangers.”
“You shall hear then—but prepare yourself for something very dreadful.
The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire, you must know, was at
a ball—and at this ball, what do you think he did? He danced only four
dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain knowledge, more
than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner. Mr. Darcy, you
cannot deny the fact.”
“I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly
beyond my own party.”
“True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball-room. Well, Colonel
Fitzwilliam, what do I play next? My fingers wait your orders.”
“Perhaps,” said Darcy, “I should have judged better, had I sought an
introduction; but I am ill-qualified to recommend myself to strangers.”
“Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?” said Elizabeth, still
addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam. “Shall we ask him why a man of sense and
education, and who has lived in the world, is ill qualified to recommend
himself to strangers?”
“I can answer your question,” said Fitzwilliam, “without applying to him.
It is because he will not give himself the trouble.”
“I certainly have not the talent which some people possess,” said Darcy,
“of conversing easily with those I have never seen before. I cannot catch their
tone of conversation, or appear interested in their concerns, as I often see
done.”
“My fingers,” said Elizabeth, “do not move over this instrument in the
masterly manner which I see so many women’s do. They have not the same
force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression. But then I have
always supposed it to be my own fault—because I will not take the trouble of
practising. It is not that I do not believe my fingers as capable as any other
woman’s of superior execution.”
Darcy smiled and said, “You are perfectly right. You have employed your
time much better. No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can think
anything wanting. We neither of us perform to strangers.”
Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to know
what they were talking of. Elizabeth immediately began playing again. Lady
Catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said to Darcy:
“Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more, and could
have the advantage of a London master. She has a very good notion of
fingering, though her taste is not equal to Anne’s. Anne would have been a
delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn.”
Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin’s
praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any
symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss de Bourgh she
derived this comfort for Miss Bingley, that he might have been just as likely to
marry her, had she been his relation.
Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth’s performance, mixing
with them many instructions on execution and taste. Elizabeth received them
with all the forbearance of civility, and, at the request of the gentlemen,
remained at the instrument till her ladyship’s carriage was ready to take them
all home.
Chapter 32
Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to Jane
while Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village, when she
was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a visitor. As she had
heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely to be Lady Catherine, and under
that apprehension was putting away her half-finished letter that she might
escape all impertinent questions, when the door opened, and, to her very great
surprise, Mr. Darcy, and Mr. Darcy only, entered the room.
He seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised for his
intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies were to be
within.
They then sat down, and when her inquiries after Rosings were made,
seemed in danger of sinking into total silence. It was absolutely necessary,
therefore, to think of something, and in this emergence recollecting when she
had seen him last in Hertfordshire, and feeling curious to know what he would
say on the subject of their hasty departure, she observed:
“How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr. Darcy!
It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr. Bingley to see you all after
him so soon; for, if I recollect right, he went but the day before. He and his
sisters were well, I hope, when you left London?”
“Perfectly so, I thank you.”
She found that she was to receive no other answer, and, after a short pause
added:
“I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of ever
returning to Netherfield again?”
“I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend very
little of his time there in the future. He has many friends, and is at a time of
life when friends and engagements are continually increasing.”
“If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for the
neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we might
possibly get a settled family there. But, perhaps, Mr. Bingley did not take the
house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own, and
we must expect him to keep it or quit it on the same principle.”
“I should not be surprised,” said Darcy, “if he were to give it up as soon as
any eligible purchase offers.”
Elizabeth made no answer. She was afraid of talking longer of his friend;
and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the trouble of
finding a subject to him.
He took the hint, and soon began with, “This seems a very comfortable
house. Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to it when Mr. Collins first
came to Hunsford.”
“I believe she did—and I am sure she could not have bestowed her
kindness on a more grateful object.”
“Mr. Collins appears to be very fortunate in his choice of a wife.”
“Yes, indeed, his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the
very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made him
happy if they had. My friend has an excellent understanding—though I am not
certain that I consider her marrying Mr. Collins as the wisest thing she ever
did. She seems perfectly happy, however, and in a prudential light it is
certainly a very good match for her.”
“It must be very agreeable for her to be settled within so easy a distance of
her own family and friends.”
“An easy distance, do you call it? It is nearly fifty miles.”
“And what is fifty miles of good road? Little more than half a day’s
journey. Yes, I call it a very easy distance.”
“I should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages of
the match,” cried Elizabeth. “I should never have said Mrs. Collins was settled
near her family.”
“It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire. Anything beyond
the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far.”
As he spoke there was a sort of smile which Elizabeth fancied she
understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and Netherfield,
and she blushed as she answered:
“I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family.
The far and the near must be relative, and depend on many varying
circumstances. Where there is fortune to make the expenses of travelling
unimportant, distance becomes no evil. But that is not the case here. Mr. and
Mrs. Collins have a comfortable income, but not such a one as will allow of
frequent journeys—and I am persuaded my friend would not call herself near
her family under less than half the present distance.”
Mr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, “You cannot have a
right to such very strong local attachment. You cannot have been always at
Longbourn.”
Elizabeth looked surprised. The gentleman experienced some change of
feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and glancing
over it, said, in a colder voice:
“Are you pleased with Kent?”
A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side calm
and concise—and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte and her
sister, just returned from her walk. The tete-a-tete surprised them. Mr. Darcy
related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on Miss Bennet, and
after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to anybody, went away.
“What can be the meaning of this?” said Charlotte, as soon as he was gone.
“My dear, Eliza, he must be in love with you, or he would never have called us
in this familiar way.”
But when Elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely, even to
Charlotte’s wishes, to be the case; and after various conjectures, they could at
last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding anything to
do, which was the more probable from the time of year. All field sports were
over. Within doors there was Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard-table, but
gentlemen cannot always be within doors; and in the nearness of the
Parsonage, or the pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in
it, the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither
almost every day. They called at various times of the morning, sometimes
separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their aunt.
It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure
in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended him still more;
and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him, as well
as by his evident admiration of her, of her former favourite George Wickham;
and though, in comparing them, she saw there was less captivating softness in
Colonel Fitzwilliam’s manners, she believed he might have the best informed
mind.
But why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more difficult to
understand. It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there ten minutes
together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, it seemed the effect
of necessity rather than of choice—a sacrifice to propriety, not a pleasure to
himself. He seldom appeared really animated. Mrs. Collins knew not what to
make of him. Colonel Fitzwilliam’s occasionally laughing at his stupidity,
proved that he was generally different, which her own knowledge of him
could not have told her; and as she would liked to have believed this change
the effect of love, and the object of that love her friend Eliza, she set herself
seriously to work to find it out. She watched him whenever they were at
Rosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success. He
certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that look was
disputable. It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often doubted whether
there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it seemed nothing but
absence of mind.
She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his being
partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs. Collins did
not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of raising expectations
which might only end in disappointment; for in her opinion it admitted not of a
doubt, that all her friend’s dislike would vanish, if she could suppose him to be
in her power.
In her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying
Colonel Fitzwilliam. He was beyond comparison the most pleasant man; he
certainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but, to
counterbalance these advantages, Mr. Darcy had considerable patronage in the
church, and his cousin could have none at all.
Chapter 33
More than once did Elizabeth, in her ramble within the park, unexpectedly
meet Mr. Darcy. She felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should
bring him where no one else was brought, and, to prevent its ever happening
again, took care to inform him at first that it was a favourite haunt of hers.
How it could occur a second time, therefore, was very odd! Yet it did, and
even a third. It seemed like wilful ill-nature, or a voluntary penance, for on
these occasions it was not merely a few formal inquiries and an awkward
pause and then away, but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and
walk with her. He never said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble
of talking or of listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third
rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions—about her
pleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her opinion of
Mr. and Mrs. Collins’s happiness; and that in speaking of Rosings and her not
perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to expect that whenever she
came into Kent again she would be staying there too. His words seemed to
imply it. Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his thoughts? She supposed, if
he meant anything, he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that
quarter. It distressed her a little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the
gate in the pales opposite the Parsonage.
She was engaged one day as she walked, in perusing Jane’s last letter, and
dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not written in spirits,
when, instead of being again surprised by Mr. Darcy, she saw on looking up
that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her. Putting away the letter immediately
and forcing a smile, she said:
“I did not know before that you ever walked this way.”
“I have been making the tour of the park,” he replied, “as I generally do
every year, and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage. Are you going
much farther?”
“No, I should have turned in a moment.”
And accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the Parsonage
together.
“Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?” said she.
“Yes—if Darcy does not put it off again. But I am at his disposal. He
arranges the business just as he pleases.”
“And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least
pleasure in the great power of choice. I do not know anybody who seems more
to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr. Darcy.”
“He likes to have his own way very well,” replied Colonel Fitzwilliam.
“But so we all do. It is only that he has better means of having it than many
others, because he is rich, and many others are poor. I speak feelingly. A
younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and dependence.”
“In my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little of either.
Now seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and dependence?
When have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you
chose, or procuring anything you had a fancy for?”
“These are home questions—and perhaps I cannot say that I have
experienced many hardships of that nature. But in matters of greater weight, I
may suffer from want of money. Younger sons cannot marry where they like.”
“Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often
do.”
“Our habits of expense make us too dependent, and there are not many in
my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money.”
“Is this,” thought Elizabeth, “meant for me?” and she coloured at the idea;
but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, “And pray, what is the usual price
of an earl’s younger son? Unless the elder brother is very sickly, I suppose you
would not ask above fifty thousand pounds.”
He answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped. To interrupt a
silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed, she
soon afterwards said:
“I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of
having someone at his disposal. I wonder he does not marry, to secure a lasting
convenience of that kind. But, perhaps, his sister does as well for the present,
and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he likes with her.”
“No,” said Colonel Fitzwilliam, “that is an advantage which he must divide
with me. I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy.”
“Are you indeed? And pray what sort of guardians do you make? Does
your charge give you much trouble? Young ladies of her age are sometimes a
little difficult to manage, and if she has the true Darcy spirit, she may like to
have her own way.”
As she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly; and the manner in
which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to give
them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty
near the truth. She directly replied:
“You need not be frightened. I never heard any harm of her; and I dare say
she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world. She is a very great
favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley. I
think I have heard you say that you know them.”
“I know them a little. Their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike man—he is
a great friend of Darcy’s.”
“Oh! yes,” said Elizabeth drily; “Mr. Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr.
Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him.”
“Care of him! Yes, I really believe Darcy does take care of him in those
points where he most wants care. From something that he told me in our
journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to him. But
I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose that Bingley was the
person meant. It was all conjecture.”
“What is it you mean?”
“It is a circumstance which Darcy could not wish to be generally known,
because if it were to get round to the lady’s family, it would be an unpleasant
thing.”
“You may depend upon my not mentioning it.”
“And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be Bingley.
What he told me was merely this: that he congratulated himself on having
lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage,
but without mentioning names or any other particulars, and I only suspected it
to be Bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of
that sort, and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last
summer.”
“Did Mr. Darcy give you reasons for this interference?”
“I understood that there were some very strong objections against the
lady.”
“And what arts did he use to separate them?”
“He did not talk to me of his own arts,” said Fitzwilliam, smiling. “He only
told me what I have now told you.”
Elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with
indignation. After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why she was so
thoughtful.
“I am thinking of what you have been telling me,” said she. “Your cousin’s
conduct does not suit my feelings. Why was he to be the judge?”
“You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?”
“I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his
friend’s inclination, or why, upon his own judgement alone, he was to
determine and direct in what manner his friend was to be happy. But,” she
continued, recollecting herself, “as we know none of the particulars, it is not
fair to condemn him. It is not to be supposed that there was much affection in
the case.”
“That is not an unnatural surmise,” said Fitzwilliam, “but it is a lessening
of the honour of my cousin’s triumph very sadly.”
This was spoken jestingly; but it appeared to her so just a picture of Mr.
Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer, and therefore, abruptly
changing the conversation talked on indifferent matters until they reached the
Parsonage. There, shut into her own room, as soon as their visitor left them,
she could think without interruption of all that she had heard. It was not to be
supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was
connected. There could not exist in the world two men over whom Mr. Darcy
could have such boundless influence. That he had been concerned in the
measures taken to separate Bingley and Jane she had never doubted; but she
had always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangement of
them. If his own vanity, however, did not mislead him, he was the cause, his
pride and caprice were the cause, of all that Jane had suffered, and still
continued to suffer. He had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the
most affectionate, generous heart in the world; and no one could say how
lasting an evil he might have inflicted.
“There were some very strong objections against the lady,” were Colonel
Fitzwilliam’s words; and those strong objections probably were, her having
one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in business in
London.
“To Jane herself,” she exclaimed, “there could be no possibility of
objection; all loveliness and goodness as she is!—her understanding excellent,
her mind improved, and her manners captivating. Neither could anything be
urged against my father, who, though with some peculiarities, has abilities Mr.
Darcy himself need not disdain, and respectability which he will probably
never reach.” When she thought of her mother, her confidence gave way a
little; but she would not allow that any objections there had material weight
with Mr. Darcy, whose pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper
wound from the want of importance in his friend’s connections, than from
their want of sense; and she was quite decided, at last, that he had been partly
governed by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of retaining Mr.
Bingley for his sister.
The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on a
headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening, that, added to her
unwillingness to see Mr. Darcy, it determined her not to attend her cousins to
Rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea. Mrs. Collins, seeing that she
was really unwell, did not press her to go and as much as possible prevented
her husband from pressing her; but Mr. Collins could not conceal his
apprehension of Lady Catherine’s being rather displeased by her staying at
home.
Chapter 34
When they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself as
much as possible against Mr. Darcy, chose for her employment the
examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her being in
Kent. They contained no actual complaint, nor was there any revival of past
occurrences, or any communication of present suffering. But in all, and in
almost every line of each, there was a want of that cheerfulness which had
been used to characterise her style, and which, proceeding from the serenity of
a mind at ease with itself and kindly disposed towards everyone, had been
scarcely ever clouded. Elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of
uneasiness, with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal.
Mr. Darcy’s shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict, gave
her a keener sense of her sister’s sufferings. It was some consolation to think
that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next—and, a still
greater, that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with Jane again, and
enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits, by all that affection could
do.
She could not think of Darcy’s leaving Kent without remembering that his
cousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear that he
had no intentions at all, and agreeable as he was, she did not mean to be
unhappy about him.
While settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the
door-bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being Colonel
Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in the evening, and might
now come to inquire particularly after her. But this idea was soon banished,
and her spirits were very differently affected, when, to her utter amazement,
she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the room. In an hurried manner he immediately
began an inquiry after her health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that
she were better. She answered him with cold civility. He sat down for a few
moments, and then getting up, walked about the room. Elizabeth was
surprised, but said not a word. After a silence of several minutes, he came
towards her in an agitated manner, and thus began:
“In vain I have struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be repressed.
You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you.”
Elizabeth’s astonishment was beyond expression. She stared, coloured,
doubted, and was silent. This he considered sufficient encouragement; and the
avowal of all that he felt, and had long felt for her, immediately followed. He
spoke well; but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed;
and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride. His
sense of her inferiority—of its being a degradation—of the family obstacles
which had always opposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which
seemed due to the consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to
recommend his suit.
In spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to the
compliment of such a man’s affection, and though her intentions did not vary
for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive; till, roused
to resentment by his subsequent language, she lost all compassion in anger.
She tried, however, to compose herself to answer him with patience, when he
should have done. He concluded with representing to her the strength of that
attachment which, in spite of all his endeavours, he had found impossible to
conquer; and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her
acceptance of his hand. As he said this, she could easily see that he had no
doubt of a favourable answer. He spoke of apprehension and anxiety, but his
countenance expressed real security. Such a circumstance could only
exasperate farther, and, when he ceased, the colour rose into her cheeks, and
she said:
“In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to express a
sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however unequally they may be
returned. It is natural that obligation should be felt, and if I could feel
gratitude, I would now thank you. But I cannot—I have never desired your
good opinion, and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly. I am sorry
to have occasioned pain to anyone. It has been most unconsciously done,
however, and I hope will be of short duration. The feelings which, you tell me,
have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard, can have little
difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation.”
Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantelpiece with his eyes fixed on
her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise. His
complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance of his mind was
visible in every feature. He was struggling for the appearance of composure,
and would not open his lips till he believed himself to have attained it. The
pause was to Elizabeth’s feelings dreadful. At length, with a voice of forced
calmness, he said:
“And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting! I
might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little endeavour at civility, I
am thus rejected. But it is of small importance.”
“I might as well inquire,” replied she, “why with so evident a desire of
offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me against
your will, against your reason, and even against your character? Was not this
some excuse for incivility, if I was uncivil? But I have other provocations. You
know I have. Had not my feelings decided against you—had they been
indifferent, or had they even been favourable, do you think that any
consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been the means of
ruining, perhaps for ever, the happiness of a most beloved sister?”
As she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; but the
emotion was short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while
she continued:
“I have every reason in the world to think ill of you. No motive can excuse
the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there. You dare not, you cannot deny,
that you have been the principal, if not the only means of dividing them from
each other—of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and
instability, and the other to its derision for disappointed hopes, and involving
them both in misery of the acutest kind.”
She paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with
an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse. He even
looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.
“Can you deny that you have done it?” she repeated.
With assumed tranquillity he then replied: “I have no wish of denying that
I did everything in my power to separate my friend from your sister, or that I
rejoice in my success. Towards him I have been kinder than towards myself.”
Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection, but its
meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her.
“But it is not merely this affair,” she continued, “on which my dislike is
founded. Long before it had taken place my opinion of you was decided. Your
character was unfolded in the recital which I received many months ago from
Mr. Wickham. On this subject, what can you have to say? In what imaginary
act of friendship can you here defend yourself? or under what
misrepresentation can you here impose upon others?”
“You take an eager interest in that gentleman’s concerns,” said Darcy, in a
less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.
“Who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling an
interest in him?”
“His misfortunes!” repeated Darcy contemptuously; “yes, his misfortunes
have been great indeed.”
“And of your infliction,” cried Elizabeth with energy. “You have reduced
him to his present state of poverty—comparative poverty. You have withheld
the advantages which you must know to have been designed for him. You
have deprived the best years of his life of that independence which was no less
his due than his desert. You have done all this! and yet you can treat the
mention of his misfortune with contempt and ridicule.”
“And this,” cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room, “is
your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you hold me! I thank you
for explaining it so fully. My faults, according to this calculation, are heavy
indeed! But perhaps,” added he, stopping in his walk, and turning towards her,
“these offenses might have been overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by
my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any
serious design. These bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I,
with greater policy, concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of
my being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by
reflection, by everything. But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence. Nor am
I ashamed of the feelings I related. They were natural and just. Could you
expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections?—to congratulate
myself on the hope of relations, whose condition in life is so decidedly
beneath my own?”
Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to
the utmost to speak with composure when she said:
“You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your
declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared me the concern
which I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a more
gentlemanlike manner.”
She saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she continued:
“You could not have made the offer of your hand in any possible way that
would have tempted me to accept it.”
Again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an
expression of mingled incredulity and mortification. She went on:
“From the very beginning—from the first moment, I may almost say—of
my acquaintance with you, your manners, impressing me with the fullest
belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the feelings
of others, were such as to form the groundwork of disapprobation on which
succeeding events have built so immovable a dislike; and I had not known you
a month before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could
ever be prevailed on to marry.”
“You have said quite enough, madam. I perfectly comprehend your
feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been.
Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best
wishes for your health and happiness.”
And with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth heard him the
next moment open the front door and quit the house.
The tumult of her mind, was now painfully great. She knew not how to
support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half-an-hour.
Her astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed, was increased by every
review of it. That she should receive an offer of marriage from Mr. Darcy!
That he should have been in love with her for so many months! So much in
love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him
prevent his friend’s marrying her sister, and which must appear at least with
equal force in his own case—was almost incredible! It was gratifying to have
inspired unconsciously so strong an affection. But his pride, his abominable
pride—his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to Jane—his
unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he could not justify it, and
the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr. Wickham, his cruelty
towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon overcame the pity which
the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited. She continued
in very agitated reflections till the sound of Lady Catherine’s carriage made
her feel how unequal she was to encounter Charlotte’s observation, and
hurried her away to her room.
Chapter 35
Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations
which had at length closed her eyes. She could not yet recover from the
surprise of what had happened; it was impossible to think of anything else;
and, totally indisposed for employment, she resolved, soon after breakfast, to
indulge herself in air and exercise. She was proceeding directly to her
favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy’s sometimes coming there
stopped her, and instead of entering the park, she turned up the lane, which led
farther from the turnpike-road. The park paling was still the boundary on one
side, and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground.
After walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was
tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and look into
the park. The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent had made a great
difference in the country, and every day was adding to the verdure of the early
trees. She was on the point of continuing her walk, when she caught a glimpse
of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park; he was moving
that way; and, fearful of its being Mr. Darcy, she was directly retreating. But
the person who advanced was now near enough to see her, and stepping
forward with eagerness, pronounced her name. She had turned away; but on
hearing herself called, though in a voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy, she
moved again towards the gate. He had by that time reached it also, and,
holding out a letter, which she instinctively took, said, with a look of haughty
composure, “I have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of
meeting you. Will you do me the honour of reading that letter?” And then,
with a slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of sight.
With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity, Elizabeth
opened the letter, and, to her still increasing wonder, perceived an envelope
containing two sheets of letter-paper, written quite through, in a very close
hand. The envelope itself was likewise full. Pursuing her way along the lane,
she then began it. It was dated from Rosings, at eight o’clock in the morning,
and was as follows:—
“Be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the apprehension of
its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those offers
which were last night so disgusting to you. I write without any intention of
paining you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on wishes which, for the
happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten; and the effort which the
formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion, should have been
spared, had not my character required it to be written and read. You must,
therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand your attention; your
feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but I demand it of your justice.
“Two offenses of a very different nature, and by no means of equal
magnitude, you last night laid to my charge. The first mentioned was, that,
regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached Mr. Bingley from your
sister, and the other, that I had, in defiance of various claims, in defiance of
honour and humanity, ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the
prospects of Mr. Wickham. Wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the
companion of my youth, the acknowledged favourite of my father, a young
man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage, and who
had been brought up to expect its exertion, would be a depravity, to which the
separation of two young persons, whose affection could be the growth of only
a few weeks, could bear no comparison. But from the severity of that blame
which was last night so liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I
shall hope to be in the future secured, when the following account of my
actions and their motives has been read. If, in the explanation of them, which
is due to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be
offensive to yours, I can only say that I am sorry. The necessity must be
obeyed, and further apology would be absurd.
“I had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common with
others, that Bingley preferred your elder sister to any other young woman in
the country. But it was not till the evening of the dance at Netherfield that I
had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment. I had often seen him
in love before. At that ball, while I had the honour of dancing with you, I was
first made acquainted, by Sir William Lucas’s accidental information, that
Bingley’s attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of
their marriage. He spoke of it as a certain event, of which the time alone could
be undecided. From that moment I observed my friend’s behaviour attentively;
and I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I
had ever witnessed in him. Your sister I also watched. Her look and manners
were open, cheerful, and engaging as ever, but without any symptom of
peculiar regard, and I remained convinced from the evening’s scrutiny, that
though she received his attentions with pleasure, she did not invite them by
any participation of sentiment. If you have not been mistaken here, I must
have been in error. Your superior knowledge of your sister must make the
latter probable. If it be so, if I have been misled by such error to inflict pain on
her, your resentment has not been unreasonable. But I shall not scruple to
assert, that the serenity of your sister’s countenance and air was such as might
have given the most acute observer a conviction that, however amiable her
temper, her heart was not likely to be easily touched. That I was desirous of
believing her indifferent is certain—but I will venture to say that my
investigation and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears. I
did not believe her to be indifferent because I wished it; I believed it on
impartial conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason. My objections to the
marriage were not merely those which I last night acknowledged to have the
utmost force of passion to put aside, in my own case; the want of connection
could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me. But there were other causes
of repugnance; causes which, though still existing, and existing to an equal
degree in both instances, I had myself endeavoured to forget, because they
were not immediately before me. These causes must be stated, though briefly.
The situation of your mother’s family, though objectionable, was nothing in
comparison to that total want of propriety so frequently, so almost uniformly
betrayed by herself, by your three younger sisters, and occasionally even by
your father. Pardon me. It pains me to offend you. But amidst your concern for
the defects of your nearest relations, and your displeasure at this representation
of them, let it give you consolation to consider that, to have conducted
yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure, is praise no less
generally bestowed on you and your elder sister, than it is honourable to the
sense and disposition of both. I will only say farther that from what passed that
evening, my opinion of all parties was confirmed, and every inducement
heightened which could have led me before, to preserve my friend from what I
esteemed a most unhappy connection. He left Netherfield for London, on the
day following, as you, I am certain, remember, with the design of soon
returning.
“The part which I acted is now to be explained. His sisters’ uneasiness had
been equally excited with my own; our coincidence of feeling was soon
discovered, and, alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their
brother, we shortly resolved on joining him directly in London. We
accordingly went—and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to
my friend the certain evils of such a choice. I described, and enforced them
earnestly. But, however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his
determination, I do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the
marriage, had it not been seconded by the assurance that I hesitated not in
giving, of your sister’s indifference. He had before believed her to return his
affection with sincere, if not with equal regard. But Bingley has great natural
modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgement than on his own. To
convince him, therefore, that he had deceived himself, was no very difficult
point. To persuade him against returning into Hertfordshire, when that
conviction had been given, was scarcely the work of a moment. I cannot
blame myself for having done thus much. There is but one part of my conduct
in the whole affair on which I do not reflect with satisfaction; it is that I
condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your
sister’s being in town. I knew it myself, as it was known to Miss Bingley; but
her brother is even yet ignorant of it. That they might have met without ill
consequence is perhaps probable; but his regard did not appear to me enough
extinguished for him to see her without some danger. Perhaps this
concealment, this disguise was beneath me; it is done, however, and it was
done for the best. On this subject I have nothing more to say, no other apology
to offer. If I have wounded your sister’s feelings, it was unknowingly done and
though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear
insufficient, I have not yet learnt to condemn them.
“With respect to that other, more weighty accusation, of having injured Mr.
Wickham, I can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection
with my family. Of what he has particularly accused me I am ignorant; but of
the truth of what I shall relate, I can summon more than one witness of
undoubted veracity.
“Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for many
years the management of all the Pemberley estates, and whose good conduct
in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service to
him; and on George Wickham, who was his godson, his kindness was
therefore liberally bestowed. My father supported him at school, and
afterwards at Cambridge—most important assistance, as his own father,
always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have been unable to
give him a gentleman’s education. My father was not only fond of this young
man’s society, whose manners were always engaging; he had also the highest
opinion of him, and hoping the church would be his profession, intended to
provide for him in it. As for myself, it is many, many years since I first began
to think of him in a very different manner. The vicious propensities—the want
of principle, which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best
friend, could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same
age with himself, and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded
moments, which Mr. Darcy could not have. Here again I shall give you pain—
to what degree you only can tell. But whatever may be the sentiments which
Mr. Wickham has created, a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me
from unfolding his real character—it adds even another motive.
“My excellent father died about five years ago; and his attachment to Mr.
Wickham was to the last so steady, that in his will he particularly
recommended it to me, to promote his advancement in the best manner that his
profession might allow—and if he took orders, desired that a valuable family
living might be his as soon as it became vacant. There was also a legacy of
one thousand pounds. His own father did not long survive mine, and within
half a year from these events, Mr. Wickham wrote to inform me that, having
finally resolved against taking orders, he hoped I should not think it
unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage, in
lieu of the preferment, by which he could not be benefited. He had some
intention, he added, of studying law, and I must be aware that the interest of
one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein. I rather
wished, than believed him to be sincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready
to accede to his proposal. I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a
clergyman; the business was therefore soon settled—he resigned all claim to
assistance in the church, were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to
receive it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds. All connection
between us seemed now dissolved. I thought too ill of him to invite him to
Pemberley, or admit his society in town. In town I believe he chiefly lived, but
his studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free from all
restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation. For about three years I
heard little of him; but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which
had been designed for him, he applied to me again by letter for the
presentation. His circumstances, he assured me, and I had no difficulty in
believing it, were exceedingly bad. He had found the law a most unprofitable
study, and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if I would present
him to the living in question—of which he trusted there could be little doubt,
as he was well assured that I had no other person to provide for, and I could
not have forgotten my revered father’s intentions. You will hardly blame me
for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every repetition to it.
His resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances—and he
was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to
myself. After this period every appearance of acquaintance was dropped. How
he lived I know not. But last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on
my notice.
“I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself,
and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to
any human being. Having said thus much, I feel no doubt of your secrecy. My
sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was left to the guardianship of my
mother’s nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and myself. About a year ago, she was
taken from school, and an establishment formed for her in London; and last
summer she went with the lady who presided over it, to Ramsgate; and thither
also went Mr. Wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there proved to have been
a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs. Younge, in whose character we
were most unhappily deceived; and by her connivance and aid, he so far
recommended himself to Georgiana, whose affectionate heart retained a strong
impression of his kindness to her as a child, that she was persuaded to believe
herself in love, and to consent to an elopement. She was then but fifteen,
which must be her excuse; and after stating her imprudence, I am happy to
add, that I owed the knowledge of it to herself. I joined them unexpectedly a
day or two before the intended elopement, and then Georgiana, unable to
support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked
up to as a father, acknowledged the whole to me. You may imagine what I felt
and how I acted. Regard for my sister’s credit and feelings prevented any
public exposure; but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left the place immediately,
and Mrs. Younge was of course removed from her charge. Mr. Wickham’s
chief object was unquestionably my sister’s fortune, which is thirty thousand
pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me
was a strong inducement. His revenge would have been complete indeed.
“This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been
concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject it as false, you will, I
hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards Mr. Wickham. I know not in
what manner, under what form of falsehood he had imposed on you; but his
success is not perhaps to be wondered at. Ignorant as you previously were of
everything concerning either, detection could not be in your power, and
suspicion certainly not in your inclination.
“You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night; but I
was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be
revealed. For the truth of everything here related, I can appeal more
particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam, who, from our near
relationship and constant intimacy, and, still more, as one of the executors of
my father’s will, has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of
these transactions. If your abhorrence of me should make my assertions
valueless, you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my
cousin; and that there may be the possibility of consulting him, I shall
endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the
course of the morning. I will only add, God bless you.
“FITZWILLIAM DARCY”
Chapter 36
If Elizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to
contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of its
contents. But such as they were, it may well be supposed how eagerly she
went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited. Her
feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined. With amazement did she first
understand that he believed any apology to be in his power; and steadfastly
was she persuaded, that he could have no explanation to give, which a just
sense of shame would not conceal. With a strong prejudice against everything
he might say, she began his account of what had happened at Netherfield. She
read with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension, and
from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring, was
incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes. His belief of her
sister’s insensibility she instantly resolved to be false; and his account of the
real, the worst objections to the match, made her too angry to have any wish of
doing him justice. He expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied
her; his style was not penitent, but haughty. It was all pride and insolence.
But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr. Wickham—
when she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which, if
true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which bore so
alarming an affinity to his own history of himself—her feelings were yet more
acutely painful and more difficult of definition. Astonishment, apprehension,
and even horror, oppressed her. She wished to discredit it entirely, repeatedly
exclaiming, “This must be false! This cannot be! This must be the grossest
falsehood!”—and when she had gone through the whole letter, though scarcely
knowing anything of the last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that
she would not regard it, that she would never look in it again.
In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on nothing,
she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the letter was unfolded
again, and collecting herself as well as she could, she again began the
mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, and commanded herself so
far as to examine the meaning of every sentence. The account of his
connection with the Pemberley family was exactly what he had related
himself; and the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy, though she had not before
known its extent, agreed equally well with his own words. So far each recital
confirmed the other; but when she came to the will, the difference was great.
What Wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory, and as she
recalled his very words, it was impossible not to feel that there was gross
duplicity on one side or the other; and, for a few moments, she flattered herself
that her wishes did not err. But when she read and re-read with the closest
attention, the particulars immediately following of Wickham’s resigning all
pretensions to the living, of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three
thousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate. She put down the letter,
weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality—
deliberated on the probability of each statement—but with little success. On
both sides it was only assertion. Again she read on; but every line proved more
clearly that the affair, which she had believed it impossible that any
contrivance could so represent as to render Mr. Darcy’s conduct in it less than
infamous, was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless
throughout the whole.
The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay at
Mr. Wickham’s charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could
bring no proof of its injustice. She had never heard of him before his entrance
into the ——shire Militia, in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the
young man who, on meeting him accidentally in town, had there renewed a
slight acquaintance. Of his former way of life nothing had been known in
Hertfordshire but what he told himself. As to his real character, had
information been in her power, she had never felt a wish of inquiring. His
countenance, voice, and manner had established him at once in the possession
of every virtue. She tried to recollect some instance of goodness, some
distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the
attacks of Mr. Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for
those casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what Mr. Darcy
had described as the idleness and vice of many years’ continuance. But no
such recollection befriended her. She could see him instantly before her, in
every charm of air and address; but she could remember no more substantial
good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and the regard which
his social powers had gained him in the mess. After pausing on this point a
considerable while, she once more continued to read. But, alas! the story
which followed, of his designs on Miss Darcy, received some confirmation
from what had passed between Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the
morning before; and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to
Colonel Fitzwilliam himself—from whom she had previously received the
information of his near concern in all his cousin’s affairs, and whose character
she had no reason to question. At one time she had almost resolved on
applying to him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the
application, and at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr. Darcy
would never have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of
his cousin’s corroboration.
She perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation
between Wickham and herself, in their first evening at Mr. Phillips’s. Many of
his expressions were still fresh in her memory. She was now struck with the
impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and wondered it had
escaped her before. She saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he
had done, and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct. She
remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing Mr. Darcy—that
Mr. Darcy might leave the country, but that he should stand his ground; yet he
had avoided the Netherfield ball the very next week. She remembered also
that, till the Netherfield family had quitted the country, he had told his story to
no one but herself; but that after their removal it had been everywhere
discussed; that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr. Darcy’s
character, though he had assured her that respect for the father would always
prevent his exposing the son.
How differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned!
His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and
hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the
moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at anything. His
behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive; he had either
been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying his vanity by
encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously
shown. Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter; and in
farther justification of Mr. Darcy, she could not but allow that Mr. Bingley,
when questioned by Jane, had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the
affair; that proud and repulsive as were his manners, she had never, in the
whole course of their acquaintance—an acquaintance which had latterly
brought them much together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways—
seen anything that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust—anything that
spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits; that among his own connections he
was esteemed and valued—that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a
brother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister
as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling; that had his actions been
what Mr. Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of everything right
could hardly have been concealed from the world; and that friendship between
a person capable of it, and such an amiable man as Mr. Bingley, was
incomprehensible.
She grew absolutely ashamed of herself. Of neither Darcy nor Wickham
could she think without feeling she had been blind, partial, prejudiced, absurd.
“How despicably I have acted!” she cried; “I, who have prided myself on
my discernment! I, who have valued myself on my abilities! who have often
disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my vanity in useless
or blameable mistrust! How humiliating is this discovery! Yet, how just a
humiliation! Had I been in love, I could not have been more wretchedly blind!
But vanity, not love, has been my folly. Pleased with the preference of one,
and offended by the neglect of the other, on the very beginning of our
acquaintance, I have courted prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason
away, where either were concerned. Till this moment I never knew myself.”
From herself to Jane—from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a line
which soon brought to her recollection that Mr. Darcy’s explanation there had
appeared very insufficient, and she read it again. Widely different was the
effect of a second perusal. How could she deny that credit to his assertions in
one instance, which she had been obliged to give in the other? He declared
himself to be totally unsuspicious of her sister’s attachment; and she could not
help remembering what Charlotte’s opinion had always been. Neither could
she deny the justice of his description of Jane. She felt that Jane’s feelings,
though fervent, were little displayed, and that there was a constant
complacency in her air and manner not often united with great sensibility.
When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were
mentioned in terms of such mortifying, yet merited reproach, her sense of
shame was severe. The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial,
and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded as having passed at the
Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first disapprobation, could not have
made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers.
The compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt. It soothed, but it
could not console her for the contempt which had thus been self-attracted by
the rest of her family; and as she considered that Jane’s disappointment had in
fact been the work of her nearest relations, and reflected how materially the
credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed
beyond anything she had ever known before.
After wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every variety
of thought—re-considering events, determining probabilities, and reconciling
herself, as well as she could, to a change so sudden and so important, fatigue,
and a recollection of her long absence, made her at length return home; and
she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual, and the
resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for
conversation.
She was immediately told that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each
called during her absence; Mr. Darcy, only for a few minutes, to take leave—
but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour,
hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be
found. Elizabeth could but just affect concern in missing him; she really
rejoiced at it. Colonel Fitzwilliam was no longer an object; she could think
only of her letter.
Chapter 37
The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning, and Mr. Collins having
been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was able
to bring home the pleasing intelligence, of their appearing in very good health,
and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the melancholy scene so
lately gone through at Rosings. To Rosings he then hastened, to console Lady
Catherine and her daughter; and on his return brought back, with great
satisfaction, a message from her ladyship, importing that she felt herself so
dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her.
Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting that, had she
chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her as her future
niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of what her ladyship’s indignation
would have been. “What would she have said? how would she have behaved?”
were questions with which she amused herself.
Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party. “I assure you, I
feel it exceedingly,” said Lady Catherine; “I believe no one feels the loss of
friends so much as I do. But I am particularly attached to these young men,
and know them to be so much attached to me! They were excessively sorry to
go! But so they always are. The dear Colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till
just at last; but Darcy seemed to feel it most acutely, more, I think, than last
year. His attachment to Rosings certainly increases.”
Mr. Collins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in here, which
were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.
Lady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed out of
spirits, and immediately accounting for it by herself, by supposing that she did
not like to go home again so soon, she added:
“But if that is the case, you must write to your mother and beg that you
may stay a little longer. Mrs. Collins will be very glad of your company, I am
sure.”
“I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation,” replied
Elizabeth, “but it is not in my power to accept it. I must be in town next
Saturday.”
“Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks. I expected you
to stay two months. I told Mrs. Collins so before you came. There can be no
occasion for your going so soon. Mrs. Bennet could certainly spare you for
another fortnight.”
“But my father cannot. He wrote last week to hurry my return.”
“Oh! your father of course may spare you, if your mother can. Daughters
are never of so much consequence to a father. And if you will stay another
month complete, it will be in my power to take one of you as far as London,
for I am going there early in June, for a week; and as Dawson does not object
to the barouche-box, there will be very good room for one of you—and
indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, I should not object to taking
you both, as you are neither of you large.”
“You are all kindness, madam; but I believe we must abide by our original
plan.”
Lady Catherine seemed resigned. “Mrs. Collins, you must send a servant
with them. You know I always speak my mind, and I cannot bear the idea of
two young women travelling post by themselves. It is highly improper. You
must contrive to send somebody. I have the greatest dislike in the world to that
sort of thing. Young women should always be properly guarded and attended,
according to their situation in life. When my niece Georgiana went to
Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of her having two men-servants go with
her. Miss Darcy, the daughter of Mr. Darcy, of Pemberley, and Lady Anne,
could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner. I am excessively
attentive to all those things. You must send John with the young ladies, Mrs.
Collins. I am glad it occurred to me to mention it; for it would really be
discreditable to you to let them go alone.”
“My uncle is to send a servant for us.”
“Oh! Your uncle! He keeps a man-servant, does he? I am very glad you
have somebody who thinks of these things. Where shall you change horses?
Oh! Bromley, of course. If you mention my name at the Bell, you will be
attended to.”
Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey,
and as she did not answer them all herself, attention was necessary, which
Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a mind so occupied, she might
have forgotten where she was. Reflection must be reserved for solitary hours;
whenever she was alone, she gave way to it as the greatest relief; and not a day
went by without a solitary walk, in which she might indulge in all the delight
of unpleasant recollections.
Mr. Darcy’s letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart. She
studied every sentence; and her feelings towards its writer were at times
widely different. When she remembered the style of his address, she was still
full of indignation; but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned
and upbraided him, her anger was turned against herself; and his disappointed
feelings became the object of compassion. His attachment excited gratitude,
his general character respect; but she could not approve him; nor could she for
a moment repent her refusal, or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him
again. In her own past behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and
regret; and in the unhappy defects of her family, a subject of yet heavier
chagrin. They were hopeless of remedy. Her father, contented with laughing at
them, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest
daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right herself, was entirely
insensible of the evil. Elizabeth had frequently united with Jane in an
endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine and Lydia; but while they
were supported by their mother’s indulgence, what chance could there be of
improvement? Catherine, weak-spirited, irritable, and completely under
Lydia’s guidance, had been always affronted by their advice; and Lydia, selfwilled and careless, would scarcely give them a hearing. They were ignorant,
idle, and vain. While there was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt with
him; and while Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would be
going there forever.
Anxiety on Jane’s behalf was another prevailing concern; and Mr. Darcy’s
explanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former good opinion, heightened
the sense of what Jane had lost. His affection was proved to have been sincere,
and his conduct cleared of all blame, unless any could attach to the
implicitness of his confidence in his friend. How grievous then was the
thought that, of a situation so desirable in every respect, so replete with
advantage, so promising for happiness, Jane had been deprived, by the folly
and indecorum of her own family!
When to these recollections was added the development of Wickham’s
character, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom
been depressed before, were now so much affected as to make it almost
impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful.
Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of her
stay as they had been at first. The very last evening was spent there; and her
ladyship again inquired minutely into the particulars of their journey, gave
them directions as to the best method of packing, and was so urgent on the
necessity of placing gowns in the only right way, that Maria thought herself
obliged, on her return, to undo all the work of the morning, and pack her trunk
afresh.
When they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension, wished them
a good journey, and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year; and
Miss de Bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to
both.
Chapter 38
On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met for breakfast a few
minutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of paying the
parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary.
“I know not, Miss Elizabeth,” said he, “whether Mrs. Collins has yet
expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us; but I am very certain
you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it. The favour of
your company has been much felt, I assure you. We know how little there is to
tempt anyone to our humble abode. Our plain manner of living, our small
rooms and few domestics, and the little we see of the world, must make
Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself; but I hope you will
believe us grateful for the condescension, and that we have done everything in
our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly.”
Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness. She had
spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with
Charlotte, and the kind attentions she had received, must make her feel the
obliged. Mr. Collins was gratified, and with a more smiling solemnity replied:
“It gives me great pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not
disagreeably. We have certainly done our best; and most fortunately having it
in our power to introduce you to very superior society, and, from our
connection with Rosings, the frequent means of varying the humble home
scene, I think we may flatter ourselves that your Hunsford visit cannot have
been entirely irksome. Our situation with regard to Lady Catherine’s family is
indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast.
You see on what a footing we are. You see how continually we are engaged
there. In truth I must acknowledge that, with all the disadvantages of this
humble parsonage, I should not think anyone abiding in it an object of
compassion, while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings.”
Words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was
obliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth
in a few short sentences.
“You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into Hertfordshire,
my dear cousin. I flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so. Lady
Catherine’s great attentions to Mrs. Collins you have been a daily witness of;
and altogether I trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an
unfortunate—but on this point it will be as well to be silent. Only let me assure
you, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that I can from my heart most cordially wish you
equal felicity in marriage. My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one
way of thinking. There is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of
character and ideas between us. We seem to have been designed for each
other.”
Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the
case, and with equal sincerity could add, that she firmly believed and rejoiced
in his domestic comforts. She was not sorry, however, to have the recital of
them interrupted by the lady from whom they sprang. Poor Charlotte! it was
melancholy to leave her to such society! But she had chosen it with her eyes
open; and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go, she did not
seem to ask for compassion. Her home and her housekeeping, her parish and
her poultry, and all their dependent concerns, had not yet lost their charms.
At length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels
placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready. After an affectionate parting
between the friends, Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by Mr. Collins, and
as they walked down the garden he was commissioning her with his best
respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had
received at Longbourn in the winter, and his compliments to Mr. and Mrs.
Gardiner, though unknown. He then handed her in, Maria followed, and the
door was on the point of being closed, when he suddenly reminded them, with
some consternation, that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for
the ladies at Rosings.
“But,” he added, “you will of course wish to have your humble respects
delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while
you have been here.”
Elizabeth made no objection; the door was then allowed to be shut, and the
carriage drove off.
“Good gracious!” cried Maria, after a few minutes’ silence, “it seems but a
day or two since we first came! and yet how many things have happened!”
“A great many indeed,” said her companion with a sigh.
“We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there twice!
How much I shall have to tell!”
Elizabeth added privately, “And how much I shall have to conceal!”
Their journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm;
and within four hours of their leaving Hunsford they reached Mr. Gardiner’s
house, where they were to remain a few days.
Jane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her
spirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had
reserved for them. But Jane was to go home with her, and at Longbourn there
would be leisure enough for observation.
It was not without an effort, meanwhile, that she could wait even for
Longbourn, before she told her sister of Mr. Darcy’s proposals. To know that
she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish Jane, and
must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had
not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation to openness as
nothing could have conquered but the state of indecision in which she
remained as to the extent of what she should communicate; and her fear, if she
once entered on the subject, of being hurried into repeating something of
Bingley which might only grieve her sister further.
Chapter 39
It was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies set out
together from Gracechurch Street for the town of ——, in Hertfordshire; and,
as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr. Bennet’s carriage was to meet
them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman’s punctuality, both
Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining-room up stairs. These two girls had
been above an hour in the place, happily employed in visiting an opposite
milliner, watching the sentinel on guard, and dressing a salad and cucumber.
After welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table set out
with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming, “Is not this
nice? Is not this an agreeable surprise?”
“And we mean to treat you all,” added Lydia, “but you must lend us the
money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there.” Then, showing her
purchases—“Look here, I have bought this bonnet. I do not think it is very
pretty; but I thought I might as well buy it as not. I shall pull it to pieces as
soon as I get home, and see if I can make it up any better.”
And when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect unconcern,
“Oh! but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and when I have
bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, I think it will be very
tolerable. Besides, it will not much signify what one wears this summer, after
the ——shire have left Meryton, and they are going in a fortnight.”
“Are they indeed!” cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction.
“They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want papa to
take us all there for the summer! It would be such a delicious scheme; and I
dare say would hardly cost anything at all. Mamma would like to go too of all
things! Only think what a miserable summer else we shall have!”
“Yes,” thought Elizabeth, “that would be a delightful scheme indeed, and
completely do for us at once. Good Heaven! Brighton, and a whole campful of
soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia,
and the monthly balls of Meryton!”
“Now I have got some news for you,” said Lydia, as they sat down at table.
“What do you think? It is excellent news—capital news—and about a certain
person we all like!”
Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told he need
not stay. Lydia laughed, and said:
“Aye, that is just like your formality and discretion. You thought the waiter
must not hear, as if he cared! I dare say he often hears worse things said than I
am going to say. But he is an ugly fellow! I am glad he is gone. I never saw
such a long chin in my life. Well, but now for my news; it is about dear
Wickham; too good for the waiter, is it not? There is no danger of Wickham’s
marrying Mary King. There’s for you! She is gone down to her uncle at
Liverpool: gone to stay. Wickham is safe.”
“And Mary King is safe!” added Elizabeth; “safe from a connection
imprudent as to fortune.”
“She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him.”
“But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side,” said Jane.
“I am sure there is not on his. I will answer for it, he never cared three
straws about her—who could about such a nasty little freckled thing?”
Elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such coarseness
of expression herself, the coarseness of the sentiment was little other than her
own breast had harboured and fancied liberal!
As soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was ordered;
and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their boxes, work-bags,
and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of Kitty’s and Lydia’s purchases,
were seated in it.
“How nicely we are all crammed in,” cried Lydia. “I am glad I bought my
bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox! Well, now let us be
quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way home. And in the
first place, let us hear what has happened to you all since you went away.
Have you seen any pleasant men? Have you had any flirting? I was in great
hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back. Jane
will be quite an old maid soon, I declare. She is almost three-and-twenty!
Lord, how ashamed I should be of not being married before three-and-twenty!
My aunt Phillips wants you so to get husbands, you can’t think. She says
Lizzy had better have taken Mr. Collins; but I do not think there would have
been any fun in it. Lord! how I should like to be married before any of you;
and then I would chaperon you about to all the balls. Dear me! we had such a
good piece of fun the other day at Colonel Forster’s. Kitty and me were to
spend the day there, and Mrs. Forster promised to have a little dance in the
evening; (by the bye, Mrs. Forster and me are such friends!) and so she asked
the two Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so Pen was forced to
come by herself; and then, what do you think we did? We dressed up
Chamberlayne in woman’s clothes on purpose to pass for a lady, only think
what fun! Not a soul knew of it, but Colonel and Mrs. Forster, and Kitty and
me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns; and you
cannot imagine how well he looked! When Denny, and Wickham, and Pratt,
and two or three more of the men came in, they did not know him in the least.
Lord! how I laughed! and so did Mrs. Forster. I thought I should have died.
And that made the men suspect something, and then they soon found out what
was the matter.”
With such kinds of histories of their parties and good jokes, did Lydia,
assisted by Kitty’s hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her companions all
the way to Longbourn. Elizabeth listened as little as she could, but there was
no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham’s name.
Their reception at home was most kind. Mrs. Bennet rejoiced to see Jane in
undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did Mr. Bennet say
voluntarily to Elizabeth:
“I am glad you are come back, Lizzy.”
Their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the Lucases came
to meet Maria and hear the news; and various were the subjects that occupied
them: Lady Lucas was inquiring of Maria, after the welfare and poultry of her
eldest daughter; Mrs. Bennet was doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an
account of the present fashions from Jane, who sat some way below her, and,
on the other, retailing them all to the younger Lucases; and Lydia, in a voice
rather louder than any other person’s, was enumerating the various pleasures
of the morning to anybody who would hear her.
“Oh! Mary,” said she, “I wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun!
As we went along, Kitty and I drew up the blinds, and pretended there was
nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all the way, if Kitty had not
been sick; and when we got to the George, I do think we behaved very
handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the
world, and if you would have gone, we would have treated you too. And then
when we came away it was such fun! I thought we never should have got into
the coach. I was ready to die of laughter. And then we were so merry all the
way home! we talked and laughed so loud, that anybody might have heard us
ten miles off!”
To this Mary very gravely replied, “Far be it from me, my dear sister, to
depreciate such pleasures! They would doubtless be congenial with the
generality of female minds. But I confess they would have no charms for me
—I should infinitely prefer a book.”
But of this answer Lydia heard not a word. She seldom listened to anybody
for more than half a minute, and never attended to Mary at all.
In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to
Meryton, and to see how everybody went on; but Elizabeth steadily opposed
the scheme. It should not be said that the Miss Bennets could not be at home
half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers. There was another reason
too for her opposition. She dreaded seeing Mr. Wickham again, and was
resolved to avoid it as long as possible. The comfort to her of the regiment’s
approaching removal was indeed beyond expression. In a fortnight they were
to go—and once gone, she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on
his account.
She had not been many hours at home before she found that the Brighton
scheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under frequent
discussion between her parents. Elizabeth saw directly that her father had not
the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were at the same time so
vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often disheartened, had never yet
despaired of succeeding at last.
Chapter 40
Elizabeth’s impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could no
longer be overcome; and at length, resolving to suppress every particular in
which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be surprised, she related
to her the next morning the chief of the scene between Mr. Darcy and herself.
Miss Bennet’s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly
partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly natural;
and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings. She was sorry that Mr. Darcy
should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend
them; but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister’s
refusal must have given him.
“His being so sure of succeeding was wrong,” said she, “and certainly
ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his
disappointment!”
“Indeed,” replied Elizabeth, “I am heartily sorry for him; but he has other
feelings, which will probably soon drive away his regard for me. You do not
blame me, however, for refusing him?”
“Blame you! Oh, no.”
“But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham?”
“No—I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did.”
“But you will know it, when I tell you what happened the very next day.”
She then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far as
they concerned George Wickham. What a stroke was this for poor Jane! who
would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much
wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind, as was here collected in one
individual. Nor was Darcy’s vindication, though grateful to her feelings,
capable of consoling her for such discovery. Most earnestly did she labour to
prove the probability of error, and seek to clear the one without involving the
other.
“This will not do,” said Elizabeth; “you never will be able to make both of
them good for anything. Take your choice, but you must be satisfied with only
one. There is but such a quantity of merit between them; just enough to make
one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting about pretty much. For
my part, I am inclined to believe it all Darcy’s; but you shall do as you
choose.”
It was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from Jane.
“I do not know when I have been more shocked,” said she. “Wickham so
very bad! It is almost past belief. And poor Mr. Darcy! Dear Lizzy, only
consider what he must have suffered. Such a disappointment! and with the
knowledge of your ill opinion, too! and having to relate such a thing of his
sister! It is really too distressing. I am sure you must feel it so.”
“Oh! no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full
of both. I know you will do him such ample justice, that I am growing every
moment more unconcerned and indifferent. Your profusion makes me saving;
and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will be as light as a
feather.”
“Poor Wickham! there is such an expression of goodness in his
countenance! such an openness and gentleness in his manner!”
“There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those
two young men. One has got all the goodness, and the other all the appearance
of it.”
“I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as you used
to do.”
“And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike
to him, without any reason. It is such a spur to one’s genius, such an opening
for wit, to have a dislike of that kind. One may be continually abusive without
saying anything just; but one cannot always be laughing at a man without now
and then stumbling on something witty.”
“Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not treat the
matter as you do now.”
“Indeed, I could not. I was uncomfortable enough, I may say unhappy. And
with no one to speak to about what I felt, no Jane to comfort me and say that I
had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as I knew I had! Oh! how
I wanted you!”
“How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions
in speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy, for now they do appear wholly
undeserved.”
“Certainly. But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most natural
consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging. There is one point on
which I want your advice. I want to be told whether I ought, or ought not, to
make our acquaintances in general understand Wickham’s character.”
Miss Bennet paused a little, and then replied, “Surely there can be no
occasion for exposing him so dreadfully. What is your opinion?”
“That it ought not to be attempted. Mr. Darcy has not authorised me to
make his communication public. On the contrary, every particular relative to
his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself; and if I
endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct, who will believe
me? The general prejudice against Mr. Darcy is so violent, that it would be the
death of half the good people in Meryton to attempt to place him in an amiable
light. I am not equal to it. Wickham will soon be gone; and therefore it will not
signify to anyone here what he really is. Some time hence it will be all found
out, and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before. At
present I will say nothing about it.”
“You are quite right. To have his errors made public might ruin him for
ever. He is now, perhaps, sorry for what he has done, and anxious to reestablish a character. We must not make him desperate.”
The tumult of Elizabeth’s mind was allayed by this conversation. She had
got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight, and was
certain of a willing listener in Jane, whenever she might wish to talk again of
either. But there was still something lurking behind, of which prudence
forbade the disclosure. She dared not relate the other half of Mr. Darcy’s letter,
nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by her friend. Here
was knowledge in which no one could partake; and she was sensible that
nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her
in throwing off this last encumbrance of mystery. “And then,” said she, “if that
very improbable event should ever take place, I shall merely be able to tell
what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself. The liberty
of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value!”
She was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real state
of her sister’s spirits. Jane was not happy. She still cherished a very tender
affection for Bingley. Having never even fancied herself in love before, her
regard had all the warmth of first attachment, and, from her age and
disposition, greater steadiness than most first attachments often boast; and so
fervently did she value his remembrance, and prefer him to every other man,
that all her good sense, and all her attention to the feelings of her friends, were
requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets which must have been
injurious to her own health and their tranquillity.
“Well, Lizzy,” said Mrs. Bennet one day, “what is your opinion now of this
sad business of Jane’s? For my part, I am determined never to speak of it again
to anybody. I told my sister Phillips so the other day. But I cannot find out that
Jane saw anything of him in London. Well, he is a very undeserving young
man—and I do not suppose there’s the least chance in the world of her ever
getting him now. There is no talk of his coming to Netherfield again in the
summer; and I have inquired of everybody, too, who is likely to know.”
“I do not believe he will ever live at Netherfield any more.”
“Oh well! it is just as he chooses. Nobody wants him to come. Though I
shall always say he used my daughter extremely ill; and if I was her, I would
not have put up with it. Well, my comfort is, I am sure Jane will die of a
broken heart; and then he will be sorry for what he has done.”
But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation, she
made no answer.
“Well, Lizzy,” continued her mother, soon afterwards, “and so the
Collinses live very comfortable, do they? Well, well, I only hope it will last.
And what sort of table do they keep? Charlotte is an excellent manager, I dare
say. If she is half as sharp as her mother, she is saving enough. There is
nothing extravagant in their housekeeping, I dare say.”
“No, nothing at all.”
“A great deal of good management, depend upon it. Yes, yes, they will take
care not to outrun their income. They will never be distressed for money. Well,
much good may it do them! And so, I suppose, they often talk of having
Longbourn when your father is dead. They look upon it as quite their own, I
dare say, whenever that happens.”
“It was a subject which they could not mention before me.”
“No; it would have been strange if they had; but I make no doubt they
often talk of it between themselves. Well, if they can be easy with an estate
that is not lawfully their own, so much the better. I should be ashamed of
having one that was only entailed on me.”
Chapter 41
The first week of their return was soon gone. The second began. It was the
last of the regiment’s stay in Meryton, and all the young ladies in the
neighbourhood were drooping apace. The dejection was almost universal. The
elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat, drink, and sleep, and pursue the
usual course of their employments. Very frequently were they reproached for
this insensibility by Kitty and Lydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who
could not comprehend such hard-heartedness in any of the family.
“Good Heaven! what is to become of us? What are we to do?” would they
often exclaim in the bitterness of woe. “How can you be smiling so, Lizzy?”
Their affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered what she
had herself endured on a similar occasion, five-and-twenty years ago.
“I am sure,” said she, “I cried for two days together when Colonel Miller’s
regiment went away. I thought I should have broken my heart.”
“I am sure I shall break mine,” said Lydia.
“If one could but go to Brighton!” observed Mrs. Bennet.
“Oh, yes!—if one could but go to Brighton! But papa is so disagreeable.”
“A little sea-bathing would set me up forever.”
“And my aunt Phillips is sure it would do me a great deal of good,” added
Kitty.
Such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through
Longbourn House. Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense of
pleasure was lost in shame. She felt anew the justice of Mr. Darcy’s
objections; and never had she been so much disposed to pardon his
interference in the views of his friend.
But the gloom of Lydia’s prospect was shortly cleared away; for she
received an invitation from Mrs. Forster, the wife of the colonel of the
regiment, to accompany her to Brighton. This invaluable friend was a very
young woman, and very lately married. A resemblance in good humour and
good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other, and out of their
three months’ acquaintance they had been intimate two.
The rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs. Forster, the
delight of Mrs. Bennet, and the mortification of Kitty, are scarcely to be
described. Wholly inattentive to her sister’s feelings, Lydia flew about the
house in restless ecstasy, calling for everyone’s congratulations, and laughing
and talking with more violence than ever; whilst the luckless Kitty continued
in the parlour repined at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was
peevish.
“I cannot see why Mrs. Forster should not ask me as well as Lydia,” said
she, “Though I am not her particular friend. I have just as much right to be
asked as she has, and more too, for I am two years older.”
In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to make her
resigned. As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from exciting in
her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia, that she considered it as the
death warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter; and detestable
as such a step must make her were it known, she could not help secretly
advising her father not to let her go. She represented to him all the
improprieties of Lydia’s general behaviour, the little advantage she could
derive from the friendship of such a woman as Mrs. Forster, and the
probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at
Brighton, where the temptations must be greater than at home. He heard her
attentively, and then said:
“Lydia will never be easy until she has exposed herself in some public
place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or
inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances.”
“If you were aware,” said Elizabeth, “of the very great disadvantage to us
all which must arise from the public notice of Lydia’s unguarded and
imprudent manner—nay, which has already arisen from it, I am sure you
would judge differently in the affair.”
“Already arisen?” repeated Mr. Bennet. “What, has she frightened away
some of your lovers? Poor little Lizzy! But do not be cast down. Such
squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity are not
worth a regret. Come, let me see the list of pitiful fellows who have been kept
aloof by Lydia’s folly.”
“Indeed you are mistaken. I have no such injuries to resent. It is not of
particular, but of general evils, which I am now complaining. Our importance,
our respectability in the world must be affected by the wild volatility, the
assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark Lydia’s character. Excuse
me, for I must speak plainly. If you, my dear father, will not take the trouble of
checking her exuberant spirits, and of teaching her that her present pursuits are
not to be the business of her life, she will soon be beyond the reach of
amendment. Her character will be fixed, and she will, at sixteen, be the most
determined flirt that ever made herself or her family ridiculous; a flirt, too, in
the worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond
youth and a tolerable person; and, from the ignorance and emptiness of her
mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which
her rage for admiration will excite. In this danger Kitty also is comprehended.
She will follow wherever Lydia leads. Vain, ignorant, idle, and absolutely
uncontrolled! Oh! my dear father, can you suppose it possible that they will
not be censured and despised wherever they are known, and that their sisters
will not be often involved in the disgrace?”
Mr. Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject, and affectionately
taking her hand said in reply:
“Do not make yourself uneasy, my love. Wherever you and Jane are
known you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less
advantage for having a couple of—or I may say, three—very silly sisters. We
shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to Brighton. Let her go,
then. Colonel Forster is a sensible man, and will keep her out of any real
mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to anybody. At
Brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has
been here. The officers will find women better worth their notice. Let us hope,
therefore, that her being there may teach her her own insignificance. At any
rate, she cannot grow many degrees worse, without authorising us to lock her
up for the rest of her life.”
With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinion
continued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry. It was not in her
nature, however, to increase her vexations by dwelling on them. She was
confident of having performed her duty, and to fret over unavoidable evils, or
augment them by anxiety, was no part of her disposition.
Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her
father, their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united
volubility. In Lydia’s imagination, a visit to Brighton comprised every
possibility of earthly happiness. She saw, with the creative eye of fancy, the
streets of that gay bathing-place covered with officers. She saw herself the
object of attention, to tens and to scores of them at present unknown. She saw
all the glories of the camp—its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of
lines, crowded with the young and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and, to
complete the view, she saw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with
at least six officers at once.
Had she known her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such
realities as these, what would have been her sensations? They could have been
understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the same. Lydia’s
going to Brighton was all that consoled her for her melancholy conviction of
her husband’s never intending to go there himself.
But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures
continued, with little intermission, to the very day of Lydia’s leaving home.
Elizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time. Having been
frequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty well
over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so. She had even learnt to
detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted her, an affectation and
a sameness to disgust and weary. In his present behaviour to herself, moreover,
she had a fresh source of displeasure, for the inclination he soon testified of
renewing those intentions which had marked the early part of their
acquaintance could only serve, after what had since passed, to provoke her.
She lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of
such idle and frivolous gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not
but feel the reproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for
whatever cause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be
gratified, and her preference secured at any time by their renewal.
On the very last day of the regiment’s remaining at Meryton, he dined,
with other of the officers, at Longbourn; and so little was Elizabeth disposed
to part from him in good humour, that on his making some inquiry as to the
manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford, she mentioned Colonel
Fitzwilliam’s and Mr. Darcy’s having both spent three weeks at Rosings, and
asked him, if he was acquainted with the former.
He looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a moment’s recollection
and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seen him often; and, after
observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man, asked her how she had liked
him. Her answer was warmly in his favour. With an air of indifference he soon
afterwards added:
“How long did you say he was at Rosings?”
“Nearly three weeks.”
“And you saw him frequently?”
“Yes, almost every day.”
“His manners are very different from his cousin’s.”
“Yes, very different. But I think Mr. Darcy improves upon acquaintance.”
“Indeed!” cried Mr. Wickham with a look which did not escape her. “And
pray, may I ask?—” But checking himself, he added, in a gayer tone, “Is it in
address that he improves? Has he deigned to add aught of civility to his
ordinary style?—for I dare not hope,” he continued in a lower and more
serious tone, “that he is improved in essentials.”
“Oh, no!” said Elizabeth. “In essentials, I believe, he is very much what he
ever was.”
While she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to
rejoice over her words, or to distrust their meaning. There was a something in
her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious
attention, while she added:
“When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean that his
mind or his manners were in a state of improvement, but that, from knowing
him better, his disposition was better understood.”
Wickham’s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated
look; for a few minutes he was silent, till, shaking off his embarrassment, he
turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of accents:
“You, who so well know my feeling towards Mr. Darcy, will readily
comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume
even the appearance of what is right. His pride, in that direction, may be of
service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must only deter him from such
foul misconduct as I have suffered by. I only fear that the sort of cautiousness
to which you, I imagine, have been alluding, is merely adopted on his visits to
his aunt, of whose good opinion and judgement he stands much in awe. His
fear of her has always operated, I know, when they were together; and a good
deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with Miss de
Bourgh, which I am certain he has very much at heart.”
Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a
slight inclination of the head. She saw that he wanted to engage her on the old
subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge him. The rest
of the evening passed with the appearance, on his side, of usual cheerfulness,
but with no further attempt to distinguish Elizabeth; and they parted at last
with mutual civility, and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again.
When the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs. Forster to Meryton,
from whence they were to set out early the next morning. The separation
between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic. Kitty was the only
one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy. Mrs. Bennet
was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter, and impressive
in her injunctions that she should not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself
as much as possible—advice which there was every reason to believe would
be well attended to; and in the clamorous happiness of Lydia herself in bidding
farewell, the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being
heard.
Chapter 42
Had Elizabeth’s opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could not
have formed a very pleasing opinion of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort.
Her father, captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance of good
humour which youth and beauty generally give, had married a woman whose
weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in their marriage put an
end to all real affection for her. Respect, esteem, and confidence had vanished
for ever; and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown. But Mr.
Bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which
his own imprudence had brought on, in any of those pleasures which too often
console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice. He was fond of the country
and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments. To his
wife he was very little otherwise indebted, than as her ignorance and folly had
contributed to his amusement. This is not the sort of happiness which a man
would in general wish to owe to his wife; but where other powers of
entertainment are wanting, the true philosopher will derive benefit from such
as are given.
Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her father’s
behaviour as a husband. She had always seen it with pain; but respecting his
abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself, she endeavoured
to forget what she could not overlook, and to banish from her thoughts that
continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which, in exposing his
wife to the contempt of her own children, was so highly reprehensible. But she
had never felt so strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the
children of so unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils
arising from so ill-judged a direction of talents; talents, which, rightly used,
might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters, even if
incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.
When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham’s departure she found little
other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment. Their parties abroad
were less varied than before, and at home she had a mother and sister whose
constant repinings at the dullness of everything around them threw a real
gloom over their domestic circle; and, though Kitty might in time regain her
natural degree of sense, since the disturbers of her brain were removed, her
other sister, from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended, was
likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance by a situation of such
double danger as a watering-place and a camp. Upon the whole, therefore, she
found, what has been sometimes found before, that an event to which she had
been looking with impatient desire did not, in taking place, bring all the
satisfaction she had promised herself. It was consequently necessary to name
some other period for the commencement of actual felicity—to have some
other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by again
enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the present, and
prepare for another disappointment. Her tour to the Lakes was now the object
of her happiest thoughts; it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable
hours which the discontentedness of her mother and Kitty made inevitable;
and could she have included Jane in the scheme, every part of it would have
been perfect.
“But it is fortunate,” thought she, “that I have something to wish for. Were
the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain. But
here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sister’s
absence, I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure
realised. A scheme of which every part promises delight can never be
successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of
some little peculiar vexation.”
When Lydia went away she promised to write very often and very
minutely to her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always long expected,
and always very short. Those to her mother contained little else than that they
were just returned from the library, where such and such officers had attended
them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite
wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which she would have
described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry, as Mrs.
Forster called her, and they were going off to the camp; and from her
correspondence with her sister, there was still less to be learnt—for her letters
to Kitty, though rather longer, were much too full of lines under the words to
be made public.
After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health, good
humour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at Longbourn. Everything wore a
happier aspect. The families who had been in town for the winter came back
again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose. Mrs. Bennet was
restored to her usual querulous serenity; and, by the middle of June, Kitty was
so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without tears; an event of
such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope that by the following
Christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer
above once a day, unless, by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the War
Office, another regiment should be quartered in Meryton.
The time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast
approaching, and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter arrived from
Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its
extent. Mr. Gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a
fortnight later in July, and must be in London again within a month, and as
that left too short a period for them to go so far, and see so much as they had
proposed, or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on,
they were obliged to give up the Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour,
and, according to the present plan, were to go no farther northwards than
Derbyshire. In that county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of
their three weeks; and to Mrs. Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction.
The town where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where
they were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of her
curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth, Dovedale, or
the Peak.
Elizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on seeing the
Lakes, and still thought there might have been time enough. But it was her
business to be satisfied—and certainly her temper to be happy; and all was
soon right again.
With the mention of Derbyshire there were many ideas connected. It was
impossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its
owner. “But surely,” said she, “I may enter his county with impunity, and rob
it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me.”
The period of expectation was now doubled. Four weeks were to pass
away before her uncle and aunt’s arrival. But they did pass away, and Mr. and
Mrs. Gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at Longbourn. The
children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two younger boys, were to
be left under the particular care of their cousin Jane, who was the general
favourite, and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted
her for attending to them in every way—teaching them, playing with them,
and loving them.
The Gardiners stayed only one night at Longbourn, and set off the next
morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement. One enjoyment
was certain—that of suitableness of companions; a suitableness which
comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences—cheerfulness to
enhance every pleasure—and affection and intelligence, which might supply it
among themselves if there were disappointments abroad.
It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire, nor of
any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay; Oxford,
Blenheim, Warwick, Kenilworth, Birmingham, etc. are sufficiently known. A
small part of Derbyshire is all the present concern. To the little town of
Lambton, the scene of Mrs. Gardiner’s former residence, and where she had
lately learned some acquaintance still remained, they bent their steps, after
having seen all the principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of
Lambton, Elizabeth found from her aunt that Pemberley was situated. It was
not in their direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it. In talking over
their route the evening before, Mrs. Gardiner expressed an inclination to see
the place again. Mr. Gardiner declared his willingness, and Elizabeth was
applied to for her approbation.
“My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so
much?” said her aunt; “a place, too, with which so many of your
acquaintances are connected. Wickham passed all his youth there, you know.”
Elizabeth was distressed. She felt that she had no business at Pemberley,
and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it. She must own that
she was tired of seeing great houses; after going over so many, she really had
no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains.
Mrs. Gardiner abused her stupidity. “If it were merely a fine house richly
furnished,” said she, “I should not care about it myself; but the grounds are
delightful. They have some of the finest woods in the country.”
Elizabeth said no more—but her mind could not acquiesce. The possibility
of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place, instantly occurred. It would be
dreadful! She blushed at the very idea, and thought it would be better to speak
openly to her aunt than to run such a risk. But against this there were
objections; and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource, if her
private inquiries to the absence of the family were unfavourably answered.
Accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid
whether Pemberley were not a very fine place? what was the name of its
proprietor? and, with no little alarm, whether the family were down for the
summer? A most welcome negative followed the last question—and her
alarms now being removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity
to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the next morning,
and she was again applied to, could readily answer, and with a proper air of
indifference, that she had not really any dislike to the scheme. To Pemberley,
therefore, they were to go.
Chapter 43
Elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of
Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned in
at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.
The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground. They
entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through a
beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent.
Elizabeth’s mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired
every remarkable spot and point of view. They gradually ascended for half-amile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence, where
the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by Pemberley House,
situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which the road with some
abruptness wound. It was a large, handsome stone building, standing well on
rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high woody hills; and in front, a
stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater, but without any
artificial appearance. Its banks were neither formal nor falsely adorned.
Elizabeth was delighted. She had never seen a place for which nature had done
more, or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward
taste. They were all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she
felt that to be mistress of Pemberley might be something!
They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and,
while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehension of
meeting its owner returned. She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been
mistaken. On applying to see the place, they were admitted into the hall; and
Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to wonder at her
being where she was.
The housekeeper came; a respectable-looking elderly woman, much less
fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her. They followed her
into the dining-parlour. It was a large, well proportioned room, handsomely
fitted up. Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went to a window to enjoy its
prospect. The hill, crowned with wood, which they had descended, receiving
increased abruptness from the distance, was a beautiful object. Every
disposition of the ground was good; and she looked on the whole scene, the
river, the trees scattered on its banks and the winding of the valley, as far as
she could trace it, with delight. As they passed into other rooms these objects
were taking different positions; but from every window there were beauties to
be seen. The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable to
the fortune of its proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with admiration of his taste,
that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of splendour, and more
real elegance, than the furniture of Rosings.
“And of this place,” thought she, “I might have been mistress! With these
rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted! Instead of viewing them
as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, and welcomed to them
as visitors my uncle and aunt. But no,”—recollecting herself—“that could
never be; my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me; I should not have
been allowed to invite them.”
This was a lucky recollection—it saved her from something very like
regret.
She longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master was really
absent, but had not the courage for it. At length however, the question was
asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while Mrs. Reynolds
replied that he was, adding, “But we expect him to-morrow, with a large party
of friends.” How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own journey had not by any
circumstance been delayed a day!
Her aunt now called her to look at a picture. She approached and saw the
likeness of Mr. Wickham, suspended, amongst several other miniatures, over
the mantelpiece. Her aunt asked her, smilingly, how she liked it. The
housekeeper came forward, and told them it was a picture of a young
gentleman, the son of her late master’s steward, who had been brought up by
him at his own expense. “He is now gone into the army,” she added; “but I am
afraid he has turned out very wild.”
Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth could not
return it.
“And that,” said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures, “is
my master—and very like him. It was drawn at the same time as the other—
about eight years ago.”
“I have heard much of your master’s fine person,” said Mrs. Gardiner,
looking at the picture; “it is a handsome face. But, Lizzy, you can tell us
whether it is like or not.”
Mrs. Reynolds respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation
of her knowing her master.
“Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy?”
Elizabeth coloured, and said: “A little.”
“And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, ma’am?”
“Yes, very handsome.”
“I am sure I know none so handsome; but in the gallery up stairs you will
see a finer, larger picture of him than this. This room was my late master’s
favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to be then. He was
very fond of them.”
This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham’s being among them.
Mrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy, drawn
when she was only eight years old.
“And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?” said Mrs. Gardiner.
“Oh! yes—the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so
accomplished!—She plays and sings all day long. In the next room is a new
instrument just come down for her—a present from my master; she comes
here to-morrow with him.”
Mr. Gardiner, whose manners were very easy and pleasant, encouraged her
communicativeness by his questions and remarks; Mrs. Reynolds, either by
pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and
his sister.
“Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?”
“Not so much as I could wish, sir; but I dare say he may spend half his
time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months.”
“Except,” thought Elizabeth, “when she goes to Ramsgate.”
“If your master would marry, you might see more of him.”
“Yes, sir; but I do not know when that will be. I do not know who is good
enough for him.”
Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled. Elizabeth could not help saying, “It is very
much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think so.”
“I say no more than the truth, and everybody will say that knows him,”
replied the other. Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far; and she listened
with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added, “I have never known
a cross word from him in my life, and I have known him ever since he was
four years old.”
This was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her
ideas. That he was not a good-tempered man had been her firmest opinion.
Her keenest attention was awakened; she longed to hear more, and was
grateful to her uncle for saying:
“There are very few people of whom so much can be said. You are lucky in
having such a master.”
“Yes, sir, I know I am. If I were to go through the world, I could not meet
with a better. But I have always observed, that they who are good-natured
when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and he was always the
sweetest-tempered, most generous-hearted boy in the world.”
Elizabeth almost stared at her. “Can this be Mr. Darcy?” thought she.
“His father was an excellent man,” said Mrs. Gardiner.
“Yes, ma’am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him—just as
affable to the poor.”
Elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more. Mrs.
Reynolds could interest her on no other point. She related the subjects of the
pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the furniture, in vain.
Mr. Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family prejudice to which he
attributed her excessive commendation of her master, soon led again to the
subject; and she dwelt with energy on his many merits as they proceeded
together up the great staircase.
“He is the best landlord, and the best master,” said she, “that ever lived;
not like the wild young men nowadays, who think of nothing but themselves.
There is not one of his tenants or servants but will give him a good name.
Some people call him proud; but I am sure I never saw anything of it. To my
fancy, it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men.”
“In what an amiable light does this place him!” thought Elizabeth.
“This fine account of him,” whispered her aunt as they walked, “is not
quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend.”
“Perhaps we might be deceived.”
“That is not very likely; our authority was too good.”
On reaching the spacious lobby above they were shown into a very pretty
sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the
apartments below; and were informed that it was but just done to give pleasure
to Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to the room when last at Pemberley.
“He is certainly a good brother,” said Elizabeth, as she walked towards one
of the windows.
Mrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy’s delight, when she should enter the
room. “And this is always the way with him,” she added. “Whatever can give
his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment. There is nothing he
would not do for her.”
The picture-gallery, and two or three of the principal bedrooms, were all
that remained to be shown. In the former were many good paintings; but
Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already visible
below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss Darcy’s, in
crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and also more
intelligible.
In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have little to
fix the attention of a stranger. Elizabeth walked in quest of the only face
whose features would be known to her. At last it arrested her—and she beheld
a striking resemblance to Mr. Darcy, with such a smile over the face as she
remembered to have sometimes seen when he looked at her. She stood several
minutes before the picture, in earnest contemplation, and returned to it again
before they quitted the gallery. Mrs. Reynolds informed them that it had been
taken in his father’s lifetime.
There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth’s mind, a more gentle
sensation towards the original than she had ever felt at the height of their
acquaintance. The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs. Reynolds was of
no trifling nature. What praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent
servant? As a brother, a landlord, a master, she considered how many people’s
happiness were in his guardianship!—how much of pleasure or pain was it in
his power to bestow!—how much of good or evil must be done by him! Every
idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his
character, and as she stood before the canvas on which he was represented,
and fixed his eyes upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper
sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before; she remembered its
warmth, and softened its impropriety of expression.
When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen,
they returned downstairs, and, taking leave of the housekeeper, were
consigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall-door.
As they walked across the hall towards the river, Elizabeth turned back to
look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and while the former was
conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself suddenly
came forward from the road, which led behind it to the stables.
They were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his
appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight. Their eyes instantly met,
and the cheeks of both were overspread with the deepest blush. He absolutely
started, and for a moment seemed immovable from surprise; but shortly
recovering himself, advanced towards the party, and spoke to Elizabeth, if not
in terms of perfect composure, at least of perfect civility.
She had instinctively turned away; but stopping on his approach, received
his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome. Had his
first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture they had just been
examining, been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw Mr.
Darcy, the gardener’s expression of surprise, on beholding his master, must
immediately have told it. They stood a little aloof while he was talking to their
niece, who, astonished and confused, scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face,
and knew not what answer she returned to his civil inquiries after her family.
Amazed at the alteration of his manner since they last parted, every sentence
that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the
impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind, the few minutes in
which they continued were some of the most uncomfortable in her life. Nor
did he seem much more at ease; when he spoke, his accent had none of its
usual sedateness; and he repeated his inquiries as to the time of her having left
Longbourn, and of her having stayed in Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried
a way, as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts.
At length every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a few moments
without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took leave.
The others then joined her, and expressed admiration of his figure; but
Elizabeth heard not a word, and wholly engrossed by her own feelings,
followed them in silence. She was overpowered by shame and vexation. Her
coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged thing in the world!
How strange it must appear to him! In what a disgraceful light might it not
strike so vain a man! It might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in
his way again! Oh! why did she come? Or, why did he thus come a day before
he was expected? Had they been only ten minutes sooner, they should have
been beyond the reach of his discrimination; for it was plain that he was that
moment arrived—that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage. She
blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting. And his
behaviour, so strikingly altered—what could it mean? That he should even
speak to her was amazing!—but to speak with such civility, to inquire after her
family! Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified, never
had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting. What a
contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosings Park, when he put his letter
into her hand! She knew not what to think, or how to account for it.
They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and every
step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer reach of the
woods to which they were approaching; but it was some time before Elizabeth
was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered mechanically to the
repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and seemed to direct her eyes to such
objects as they pointed out, she distinguished no part of the scene. Her
thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of Pemberley House, whichever it
might be, where Mr. Darcy then was. She longed to know what at the moment
was passing in his mind—in what manner he thought of her, and whether, in
defiance of everything, she was still dear to him. Perhaps he had been civil
only because he felt himself at ease; yet there had been that in his voice which
was not like ease. Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing
her she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with composure.
At length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind
aroused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.
They entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a while,
ascended some of the higher grounds; when, in spots where the opening of the
trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of the valley,
the opposite hills, with the long range of woods overspreading many, and
occasionally part of the stream. Mr. Gardiner expressed a wish of going round
the whole park, but feared it might be beyond a walk. With a triumphant smile
they were told that it was ten miles round. It settled the matter; and they
pursued the accustomed circuit; which brought them again, after some time, in
a descent among hanging woods, to the edge of the water, and one of its
narrowest parts. They crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the
general air of the scene; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet
visited; and the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the
stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered it.
Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed the
bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner, who was
not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only of returning to the
carriage as quickly as possible. Her niece was, therefore, obliged to submit,
and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river, in
the nearest direction; but their progress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though
seldom able to indulge the taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much
engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and
talking to the man about them, that he advanced but little. Whilst wandering
on in this slow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth’s
astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr.
Darcy approaching them, and at no great distance. The walk here being here
less sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before they met.
Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared for an interview
than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness, if he really
intended to meet them. For a few moments, indeed, she felt that he would
probably strike into some other path. The idea lasted while a turning in the
walk concealed him from their view; the turning past, he was immediately
before them. With a glance, she saw that he had lost none of his recent civility;
and, to imitate his politeness, she began, as they met, to admire the beauty of
the place; but she had not got beyond the words “delightful,” and “charming,”
when some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of
Pemberley from her might be mischievously construed. Her colour changed,
and she said no more.
Mrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked
her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends. This was
a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared; and she could hardly
suppress a smile at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those
very people against whom his pride had revolted in his offer to herself. “What
will be his surprise,” thought she, “when he knows who they are? He takes
them now for people of fashion.”
The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their
relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore it, and
was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from
such disgraceful companions. That he was surprised by the connection was
evident; he sustained it, however, with fortitude, and so far from going away,
turned back with them, and entered into conversation with Mr. Gardiner.
Elizabeth could not but be pleased, could not but triumph. It was consoling
that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to
blush. She listened most attentively to all that passed between them, and
gloried in every expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his
intelligence, his taste, or his good manners.
The conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she heard Mr. Darcy invite
him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he chose while he
continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same time to supply him with
fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was
usually most sport. Mrs. Gardiner, who was walking arm-in-arm with
Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of wonder. Elizabeth said nothing, but it
gratified her exceedingly; the compliment must be all for herself. Her
astonishment, however, was extreme, and continually was she repeating,
“Why is he so altered? From what can it proceed? It cannot be for me—it
cannot be for my sake that his manners are thus softened. My reproofs at
Hunsford could not work such a change as this. It is impossible that he should
still love me.”
After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two
gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to the brink of
the river for the better inspection of some curious water-plant, there chanced to
be a little alteration. It originated in Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the
exercise of the morning, found Elizabeth’s arm inadequate to her support, and
consequently preferred her husband’s. Mr. Darcy took her place by her niece,
and they walked on together. After a short silence, the lady first spoke. She
wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came
to the place, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been
very unexpected—“for your housekeeper,” she added, “informed us that you
would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed, before we left
Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected in the
country.” He acknowledged the truth of it all, and said that business with his
steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the
party with whom he had been travelling. “They will join me early to-morrow,”
he continued, “and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with
you—Mr. Bingley and his sisters.”
Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow. Her thoughts were instantly
driven back to the time when Mr. Bingley’s name had been the last mentioned
between them; and, if she might judge by his complexion, his mind was not
very differently engaged.
“There is also one other person in the party,” he continued after a pause,
“who more particularly wishes to be known to you. Will you allow me, or do I
ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at
Lambton?”
The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great for
her to know in what manner she acceded to it. She immediately felt that
whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her must be
the work of her brother, and, without looking farther, it was satisfactory; it was
gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her.
They now walked on in silence, each of them deep in thought. Elizabeth
was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and pleased.
His wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of the highest kind.
They soon outstripped the others, and when they had reached the carriage, Mr.
and Mrs. Gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind.
He then asked her to walk into the house—but she declared herself not
tired, and they stood together on the lawn. At such a time much might have
been said, and silence was very awkward. She wanted to talk, but there
seemed to be an embargo on every subject. At last she recollected that she had
been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale with great
perseverance. Yet time and her aunt moved slowly—and her patience and her
ideas were nearly worn out before the tete-a-tete was over. On Mr. and Mrs.
Gardiner’s coming up they were all pressed to go into the house and take some
refreshment; but this was declined, and they parted on each side with utmost
politeness. Mr. Darcy handed the ladies into the carriage; and when it drove
off, Elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house.
The observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them
pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had expected. “He is
perfectly well behaved, polite, and unassuming,” said her uncle.
“There is something a little stately in him, to be sure,” replied her aunt,
“but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming. I can now say with the
housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud, I have seen
nothing of it.”
“I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us. It was more than
civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such attention. His
acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling.”
“To be sure, Lizzy,” said her aunt, “he is not so handsome as Wickham; or,
rather, he has not Wickham’s countenance, for his features are perfectly good.
But how came you to tell me that he was so disagreeable?”
Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had liked him
better when they had met in Kent than before, and that she had never seen him
so pleasant as this morning.
“But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities,” replied her
uncle. “Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him at his
word, as he might change his mind another day, and warn me off his grounds.”
Elizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his character, but said
nothing.
“From what we have seen of him,” continued Mrs. Gardiner, “I really
should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by
anybody as he has done by poor Wickham. He has not an ill-natured look. On
the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks. And
there is something of dignity in his countenance that would not give one an
unfavourable idea of his heart. But, to be sure, the good lady who showed us
his house did give him a most flaming character! I could hardly help laughing
aloud sometimes. But he is a liberal master, I suppose, and that in the eye of a
servant comprehends every virtue.”
Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his
behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave them to understand, in as guarded a
manner as she could, that by what she had heard from his relations in Kent, his
actions were capable of a very different construction; and that his character
was by no means so faulty, nor Wickham’s so amiable, as they had been
considered in Hertfordshire. In confirmation of this, she related the particulars
of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected, without
actually naming her authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.
Mrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now
approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to the
charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her
husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of anything else.
Fatigued as she had been by the morning’s walk they had no sooner dined than
she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance, and the evening was
spent in the satisfactions of a intercourse renewed after many years’
discontinuance.
The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth
much attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing but
think, and think with wonder, of Mr. Darcy’s civility, and, above all, of his
wishing her to be acquainted with his sister.
Chapter 44
Elizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to visit her the
very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was consequently resolved not to
be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning. But her conclusion was
false; for on the very morning after their arrival at Lambton, these visitors
came. They had been walking about the place with some of their new friends,
and were just returning to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same
family, when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a
gentleman and a lady in a curricle driving up the street. Elizabeth immediately
recognizing the livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of
her surprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour which she
expected. Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment of
her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many of the
circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on the
business. Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they felt that there was no
other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter than by
supposing a partiality for their niece. While these newly-born notions were
passing in their heads, the perturbation of Elizabeth’s feelings was at every
moment increasing. She was quite amazed at her own discomposure; but
amongst other causes of disquiet, she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother
should have said too much in her favour; and, more than commonly anxious to
please, she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.
She retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked up
and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks of
inquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worse.
Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction
took place. With astonishment did Elizabeth see that her new acquaintance
was at least as much embarrassed as herself. Since her being at Lambton, she
had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud; but the observation of a
very few minutes convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy. She found
it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable.
Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, though little
more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance womanly and
graceful. She was less handsome than her brother; but there was sense and
good humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly unassuming and
gentle. Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed
an observer as ever Mr. Darcy had been, was much relieved by discerning
such different feelings.
They had not long been together before Mr. Darcy told her that Bingley
was also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her
satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley’s quick step was
heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room. All Elizabeth’s
anger against him had been long done away; but had she still felt any, it could
hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he
expressed himself on seeing her again. He inquired in a friendly, though
general way, after her family, and looked and spoke with the same goodhumoured ease that he had ever done.
To Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than
to herself. They had long wished to see him. The whole party before them,
indeed, excited a lively attention. The suspicions which had just arisen of Mr.
Darcy and their niece directed their observation towards each with an earnest
though guarded inquiry; and they soon drew from those inquiries the full
conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love. Of the lady’s
sensations they remained a little in doubt; but that the gentleman was
overflowing with admiration was evident enough.
Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do. She wanted to ascertain the
feelings of each of her visitors; she wanted to compose her own, and to make
herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she feared most to fail,
she was most sure of success, for those to whom she endeavoured to give
pleasure were prepossessed in her favour. Bingley was ready, Georgiana was
eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased.
In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and, oh! how
ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a like
manner. Sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on former
occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that, as he looked
at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance. But, though this might be
imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to Miss Darcy, who
had been set up as a rival to Jane. No look appeared on either side that spoke
particular regard. Nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes
of his sister. On this point she was soon satisfied; and two or three little
circumstances occurred ere they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation,
denoted a recollection of Jane not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of
saying more that might lead to the mention of her, had he dared. He observed
to her, at a moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone which
had something of real regret, that it “was a very long time since he had had the
pleasure of seeing her;” and, before she could reply, he added, “It is above
eight months. We have not met since the 26th of November, when we were all
dancing together at Netherfield.”
Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards took
occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest, whether all her
sisters were at Longbourn. There was not much in the question, nor in the
preceding remark; but there was a look and a manner which gave them
meaning.
It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself; but,
whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an expression of general
complaisance, and in all that he said she heard an accent so removed from
hauteur or disdain of his companions, as convinced her that the improvement
of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however temporary its
existence might prove, had at least outlived one day. When she saw him thus
seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion of people with whom
any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace—when she saw
him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the very relations whom he had
openly disdained, and recollected their last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage
—the difference, the change was so great, and struck so forcibly on her mind,
that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible. Never, even
in the company of his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations at
Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from self-consequence
or unbending reserve, as now, when no importance could result from the
success of his endeavours, and when even the acquaintance of those to whom
his attentions were addressed would draw down the ridicule and censure of the
ladies both of Netherfield and Rosings.
Their visitors stayed with them above half-an-hour; and when they arose to
depart, Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of
seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinner at Pemberley, before
they left the country. Miss Darcy, though with a diffidence which marked her
little in the habit of giving invitations, readily obeyed. Mrs. Gardiner looked at
her niece, desirous of knowing how she, whom the invitation most concerned,
felt disposed as to its acceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head.
Presuming however, that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary
embarrassment than any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband,
who was fond of society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to
engage for her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.
Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth again,
having still a great deal to say to her, and many inquiries to make after all their
Hertfordshire friends. Elizabeth, construing all this into a wish of hearing her
speak of her sister, was pleased, and on this account, as well as some others,
found herself, when their visitors left them, capable of considering the last
half-hour with some satisfaction, though while it was passing, the enjoyment
of it had been little. Eager to be alone, and fearful of inquiries or hints from
her uncle and aunt, she stayed with them only long enough to hear their
favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.
But she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner’s curiosity; it was not
their wish to force her communication. It was evident that she was much better
acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had before any idea of; it was evident
that he was very much in love with her. They saw much to interest, but
nothing to justify inquiry.
Of Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far as
their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find. They could not be
untouched by his politeness; and had they drawn his character from their own
feelings and his servant’s report, without any reference to any other account,
the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known would not have recognized
it for Mr. Darcy. There was now an interest, however, in believing the
housekeeper; and they soon became sensible that the authority of a servant
who had known him since he was four years old, and whose own manners
indicated respectability, was not to be hastily rejected. Neither had anything
occurred in the intelligence of their Lambton friends that could materially
lessen its weight. They had nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he
probably had, and if not, it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a
small market-town where the family did not visit. It was acknowledged,
however, that he was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.
With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held
there in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns with the son of
his patron were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well-known fact that, on
his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts behind him, which Mr. Darcy
afterwards discharged.
As for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than
the last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not long
enough to determine her feelings towards one in that mansion; and she lay
awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out. She certainly did not
hate him. No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she had almost as long been
ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him, that could be so called. The
respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities, though at first
unwillingly admitted, had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feeling;
and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the
testimony so highly in his favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so
amiable a light, which yesterday had produced. But above all, above respect
and esteem, there was a motive within her of goodwill which could not be
overlooked. It was gratitude; gratitude, not merely for having once loved her,
but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and acrimony
of her manner in rejecting him, and all the unjust accusations accompanying
her rejection. He who, she had been persuaded, would avoid her as his greatest
enemy, seemed, on this accidental meeting, most eager to preserve the
acquaintance, and without any indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity
of manner, where their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the
good opinion of her friends, and bent on making her known to his sister. Such
a change in a man of so much pride exciting not only astonishment but
gratitude—for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and as such its
impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by no means unpleasing,
though it could not be exactly defined. She respected, she esteemed, she was
grateful to him, she felt a real interest in his welfare; and she only wanted to
know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself, and how far it
would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power, which
her fancy told her she still possessed, of bringing on her the renewal of his
addresses.
It had been settled in the evening between the aunt and the niece, that such
a striking civility as Miss Darcy’s in coming to see them on the very day of her
arrival at Pemberley, for she had reached it only to a late breakfast, ought to be
imitated, though it could not be equalled, by some exertion of politeness on
their side; and, consequently, that it would be highly expedient to wait on her
at Pemberley the following morning. They were, therefore, to go. Elizabeth
was pleased; though when she asked herself the reason, she had very little to
say in reply.
Mr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast. The fishing scheme had been
renewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his meeting some
of the gentlemen at Pemberley before noon.
Chapter 45
Convinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley’s dislike of her had
originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how unwelcome her
appearance at Pemberley must be to her, and was curious to know with how
much civility on that lady’s side the acquaintance would now be renewed.
On reaching the house, they were shown through the hall into the saloon,
whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer. Its windows opening
to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind
the house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chestnuts which were
scattered over the intermediate lawn.
In this house they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there with
Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in London.
Georgiana’s reception of them was very civil, but attended with all the
embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing
wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior the belief of her
being proud and reserved. Mrs. Gardiner and her niece, however, did her
justice, and pitied her.
By Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley they were noticed only by a curtsey; and,
on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be,
succeeded for a few moments. It was first broken by Mrs. Annesley, a genteel,
agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind of
discourse proved her to be more truly well-bred than either of the others; and
between her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help from Elizabeth, the
conversation was carried on. Miss Darcy looked as if she wished for courage
enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a short sentence when there
was least danger of its being heard.
Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley,
and that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without calling
her attention. This observation would not have prevented her from trying to
talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance; but she
was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much. Her own thoughts
were employing her. She expected every moment that some of the gentlemen
would enter the room. She wished, she feared that the master of the house
might be amongst them; and whether she wished or feared it most, she could
scarcely determine. After sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without
hearing Miss Bingley’s voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a
cold inquiry after the health of her family. She answered with equal
indifference and brevity, and the other said no more.
The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance
of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the finest fruits in season;
but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from
Mrs. Annesley to Miss Darcy had been given, to remind her of her post. There
was now employment for the whole party—for though they could not all talk,
they could all eat; and the beautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and
peaches soon collected them round the table.
While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether
she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr. Darcy, by the feelings
which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but a moment
before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to regret that he
came.
He had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three other
gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had left him only on
learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to Georgiana that
morning. No sooner did he appear than Elizabeth wisely resolved to be
perfectly easy and unembarrassed; a resolution the more necessary to be made,
but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she saw that the suspicions of
the whole party were awakened against them, and that there was scarcely an
eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room. In no
countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley’s,
in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of
its objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions to
Mr. Darcy were by no means over. Miss Darcy, on her brother’s entrance,
exerted herself much more to talk, and Elizabeth saw that he was anxious for
his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded as much as possible,
every attempt at conversation on either side. Miss Bingley saw all this
likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the first opportunity of saying,
with sneering civility:
“Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ——shire Militia removed from Meryton?
They must be a great loss to your family.”
In Darcy’s presence she dared not mention Wickham’s name; but Elizabeth
instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the
various recollections connected with him gave her a moment’s distress; but
exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she presently
answered the question in a tolerably detached tone. While she spoke, an
involuntary glance showed her Darcy, with a heightened complexion,
earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with confusion, and unable to
lift up her eyes. Had Miss Bingley known what pain she was then giving her
beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint; but she
had merely intended to discompose Elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of
a man to whom she believed her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which
might injure her in Darcy’s opinion, and, perhaps, to remind the latter of all
the follies and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected
with that corps. Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy’s meditated
elopement. To no creature had it been revealed, where secrecy was possible,
except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley’s connections her brother was
particularly anxious to conceal it, from the very wish which Elizabeth had
long ago attributed to him, of their becoming hereafter her own. He had
certainly formed such a plan, and without meaning that it should affect his
endeavour to separate him from Miss Bennet, it is probable that it might add
something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend.
Elizabeth’s collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and as
Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to Wickham,
Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able to speak any
more. Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely recollected her
interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which had been designed to
turn his thoughts from Elizabeth seemed to have fixed them on her more and
more cheerfully.
Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above
mentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their carriage Miss
Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth’s person,
behaviour, and dress. But Georgiana would not join her. Her brother’s
recommendation was enough to ensure her favour; his judgement could not
err. And he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth as to leave Georgiana
without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable. When
Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help repeating to him
some part of what she had been saying to his sister.
“How very ill Miss Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy,” she cried;
“I never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since the winter. She
is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and I were agreeing that we should not
have known her again.”
However little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he contented
himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration than her
being rather tanned, no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer.
“For my own part,” she rejoined, “I must confess that I never could see any
beauty in her. Her face is too thin; her complexion has no brilliancy; and her
features are not at all handsome. Her nose wants character—there is nothing
marked in its lines. Her teeth are tolerable, but not out of the common way;
and as for her eyes, which have sometimes been called so fine, I could never
see anything extraordinary in them. They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I
do not like at all; and in her air altogether there is a self-sufficiency without
fashion, which is intolerable.”
Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was not
the best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always
wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the success
she expected. He was resolutely silent, however, and, from a determination of
making him speak, she continued:
“I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed we all
were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollect your
saying one night, after they had been dining at Netherfield, ‘She a beauty!—I
should as soon call her mother a wit.’ But afterwards she seemed to improve
on you, and I believe you thought her rather pretty at one time.”
“Yes,” replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, “but that was
only when I first saw her, for it is many months since I have considered her as
one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance.”
He then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of
having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself.
Mrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their
visit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested them both. The
look and behaviour of everybody they had seen were discussed, except of the
person who had mostly engaged their attention. They talked of his sister, his
friends, his house, his fruit—of everything but himself; yet Elizabeth was
longing to know what Mrs. Gardiner thought of him, and Mrs. Gardiner would
have been highly gratified by her niece’s beginning the subject.
Chapter 46
Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from
Jane on their first arrival at Lambton; and this disappointment had been
renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but on the
third her repining was over, and her sister justified, by the receipt of two
letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that it had been missent
elsewhere. Elizabeth was not surprised at it, as Jane had written the direction
remarkably ill.
They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and her uncle
and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by themselves. The one
missent must first be attended to; it had been written five days ago. The
beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements, with
such news as the country afforded; but the latter half, which was dated a day
later, and written in evident agitation, gave more important intelligence. It was
to this effect:
“Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred of a most
unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of alarming you—be assured
that we are all well. What I have to say relates to poor Lydia. An express came
at twelve last night, just as we were all gone to bed, from Colonel Forster, to
inform us that she was gone off to Scotland with one of his officers; to own
the truth, with Wickham! Imagine our surprise. To Kitty, however, it does not
seem so wholly unexpected. I am very, very sorry. So imprudent a match on
both sides! But I am willing to hope the best, and that his character has been
misunderstood. Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him, but this
step (and let us rejoice over it) marks nothing bad at heart. His choice is
disinterested at least, for he must know my father can give her nothing. Our
poor mother is sadly grieved. My father bears it better. How thankful am I that
we never let them know what has been said against him; we must forget it
ourselves. They were off Saturday night about twelve, as is conjectured, but
were not missed till yesterday morning at eight. The express was sent off
directly. My dear Lizzy, they must have passed within ten miles of us. Colonel
Forster gives us reason to expect him here soon. Lydia left a few lines for his
wife, informing her of their intention. I must conclude, for I cannot be long
from my poor mother. I am afraid you will not be able to make it out, but I
hardly know what I have written.”
Without allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowing
what she felt, Elizabeth on finishing this letter instantly seized the other, and
opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows: it had been written a
day later than the conclusion of the first.
“By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried letter; I
wish this may be more intelligible, but though not confined for time, my head
is so bewildered that I cannot answer for being coherent. Dearest Lizzy, I
hardly know what I would write, but I have bad news for you, and it cannot be
delayed. Imprudent as the marriage between Mr. Wickham and our poor Lydia
would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place, for there is but
too much reason to fear they are not gone to Scotland. Colonel Forster came
yesterday, having left Brighton the day before, not many hours after the
express. Though Lydia’s short letter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand that
they were going to Gretna Green, something was dropped by Denny
expressing his belief that W. never intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at
all, which was repeated to Colonel F., who, instantly taking the alarm, set off
from B. intending to trace their route. He did trace them easily to Clapham,
but no further; for on entering that place, they removed into a hackney coach,
and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom. All that is known
after this is, that they were seen to continue the London road. I know not what
to think. After making every possible inquiry on that side London, Colonel F.
came on into Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes, and
at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but without any success—no such people
had been seen to pass through. With the kindest concern he came on to
Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to
his heart. I am sincerely grieved for him and Mrs. F., but no one can throw any
blame on them. Our distress, my dear Lizzy, is very great. My father and
mother believe the worst, but I cannot think so ill of him. Many circumstances
might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to
pursue their first plan; and even if he could form such a design against a young
woman of Lydia’s connections, which is not likely, can I suppose her so lost to
everything? Impossible! I grieve to find, however, that Colonel F. is not
disposed to depend upon their marriage; he shook his head when I expressed
my hopes, and said he feared W. was not a man to be trusted. My poor mother
is really ill, and keeps her room. Could she exert herself, it would be better;
but this is not to be expected. And as to my father, I never in my life saw him
so affected. Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment; but as
it was a matter of confidence, one cannot wonder. I am truly glad, dearest
Lizzy, that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes; but
now, as the first shock is over, shall I own that I long for your return? I am not
so selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient. Adieu! I take up my pen
again to do what I have just told you I would not; but circumstances are such
that I cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as possible. I
know my dear uncle and aunt so well, that I am not afraid of requesting it,
though I have still something more to ask of the former. My father is going to
London with Colonel Forster instantly, to try to discover her. What he means
to do I am sure I know not; but his excessive distress will not allow him to
pursue any measure in the best and safest way, and Colonel Forster is obliged
to be at Brighton again to-morrow evening. In such an exigence, my uncle’s
advice and assistance would be everything in the world; he will immediately
comprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness.”
“Oh! where, where is my uncle?” cried Elizabeth, darting from her seat as
she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing a moment of
the time so precious; but as she reached the door it was opened by a servant,
and Mr. Darcy appeared. Her pale face and impetuous manner made him start,
and before he could recover himself to speak, she, in whose mind every idea
was superseded by Lydia’s situation, hastily exclaimed, “I beg your pardon,
but I must leave you. I must find Mr. Gardiner this moment, on business that
cannot be delayed; I have not an instant to lose.”
“Good God! what is the matter?” cried he, with more feeling than
politeness; then recollecting himself, “I will not detain you a minute; but let
me, or let the servant go after Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner. You are not well enough;
you cannot go yourself.”
Elizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her and she felt how little
would be gained by her attempting to pursue them. Calling back the servant,
therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless an accent as made
her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and mistress home instantly.
On his quitting the room she sat down, unable to support herself, and
looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her, or to
refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration, “Let me call
your maid. Is there nothing you could take to give you present relief? A glass
of wine; shall I get you one? You are very ill.”
“No, I thank you,” she replied, endeavouring to recover herself. “There is
nothing the matter with me. I am quite well; I am only distressed by some
dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn.”
She burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could not
speak another word. Darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say something
indistinctly of his concern, and observe her in compassionate silence. At
length she spoke again. “I have just had a letter from Jane, with such dreadful
news. It cannot be concealed from anyone. My younger sister has left all her
friends—has eloped; has thrown herself into the power of—of Mr. Wickham.
They are gone off together from Brighton. You know him too well to doubt the
rest. She has no money, no connections, nothing that can tempt him to—she is
lost for ever.”
Darcy was fixed in astonishment. “When I consider,” she added in a yet
more agitated voice, “that I might have prevented it! I, who knew what he
was. Had I but explained some part of it only—some part of what I learnt, to
my own family! Had his character been known, this could not have happened.
But it is all—all too late now.”
“I am grieved indeed,” cried Darcy; “grieved—shocked. But is it certain—
absolutely certain?”
“Oh, yes! They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were traced
almost to London, but not beyond; they are certainly not gone to Scotland.”
“And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?”
“My father is gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my uncle’s
immediate assistance; and we shall be off, I hope, in half-an-hour. But nothing
can be done—I know very well that nothing can be done. How is such a man
to be worked on? How are they even to be discovered? I have not the smallest
hope. It is every way horrible!”
Darcy shook his head in silent acquiescence.
“When my eyes were opened to his real character—Oh! had I known what
I ought, what I dared to do! But I knew not—I was afraid of doing too much.
Wretched, wretched mistake!”
Darcy made no answer. He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking
up and down the room in earnest meditation, his brow contracted, his air
gloomy. Elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it. Her power was
sinking; everything must sink under such a proof of family weakness, such an
assurance of the deepest disgrace. She could neither wonder nor condemn, but
the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom,
afforded no palliation of her distress. It was, on the contrary, exactly calculated
to make her understand her own wishes; and never had she so honestly felt
that she could have loved him, as now, when all love must be vain.
But self, though it would intrude, could not engross her. Lydia—the
humiliation, the misery she was bringing on them all, soon swallowed up
every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief, Elizabeth was
soon lost to everything else; and, after a pause of several minutes, was only
recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion, who, in a
manner which, though it spoke compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said, “I
am afraid you have been long desiring my absence, nor have I anything to
plead in excuse of my stay, but real, though unavailing concern. Would to
Heaven that anything could be either said or done on my part that might offer
consolation to such distress! But I will not torment you with vain wishes,
which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks. This unfortunate affair will,
I fear, prevent my sister’s having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley today.”
“Oh, yes. Be so kind as to apologise for us to Miss Darcy. Say that urgent
business calls us home immediately. Conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is
possible, I know it cannot be long.”
He readily assured her of his secrecy; again expressed his sorrow for her
distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to
hope, and leaving his compliments for her relations, with only one serious,
parting look, went away.
As he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they
should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked
their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she threw a retrospective glance
over the whole of their acquaintance, so full of contradictions and varieties,
sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted
its continuance, and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination.
If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, Elizabeth’s
change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty. But if otherwise—if
regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural, in
comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its
object, and even before two words have been exchanged, nothing can be said
in her defence, except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter
method in her partiality for Wickham, and that its ill success might, perhaps,
authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment. Be that as
it may, she saw him go with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia’s
infamy must produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that
wretched business. Never, since reading Jane’s second letter, had she
entertained a hope of Wickham’s meaning to marry her. No one but Jane, she
thought, could flatter herself with such an expectation. Surprise was the least
of her feelings on this development. While the contents of the first letter
remained in her mind, she was all surprise—all astonishment that Wickham
should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for money; and
how Lydia could ever have attached him had appeared incomprehensible. But
now it was all too natural. For such an attachment as this she might have
sufficient charms; and though she did not suppose Lydia to be deliberately
engaging in an elopement without the intention of marriage, she had no
difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would
preserve her from falling an easy prey.
She had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that
Lydia had any partiality for him; but she was convinced that Lydia wanted
only encouragement to attach herself to anybody. Sometimes one officer,
sometimes another, had been her favourite, as their attentions raised them in
her opinion. Her affections had continually been fluctuating but never without
an object. The mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a
girl—oh! how acutely did she now feel it!
She was wild to be at home—to hear, to see, to be upon the spot to share
with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a family so
deranged, a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and requiring
constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done
for Lydia, her uncle’s interference seemed of the utmost importance, and till he
entered the room her impatience was severe. Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner had
hurried back in alarm, supposing by the servant’s account that their niece was
taken suddenly ill; but satisfying them instantly on that head, she eagerly
communicated the cause of their summons, reading the two letters aloud, and
dwelling on the postscript of the last with trembling energy.— Though Lydia
had never been a favourite with them, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner could not but be
deeply afflicted. Not Lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after the first
exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr. Gardiner promised every assistance
in his power. Elizabeth, though expecting no less, thanked him with tears of
gratitude; and all three being actuated by one spirit, everything relating to their
journey was speedily settled. They were to be off as soon as possible. “But
what is to be done about Pemberley?” cried Mrs. Gardiner. “John told us Mr.
Darcy was here when you sent for us; was it so?”
“Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement. That is
all settled.”
“What is all settled?” repeated the other, as she ran into her room to
prepare. “And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth?
Oh, that I knew how it was!”
But wishes were vain, or at least could only serve to amuse her in the hurry
and confusion of the following hour. Had Elizabeth been at leisure to be idle,
she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one
so wretched as herself; but she had her share of business as well as her aunt,
and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends at
Lambton, with false excuses for their sudden departure. An hour, however,
saw the whole completed; and Mr. Gardiner meanwhile having settled his
account at the inn, nothing remained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after
all the misery of the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she
could have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn.
Chapter 47
“I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth,” said her uncle, as they
drove from the town; “and really, upon serious consideration, I am much more
inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does on the matter. It appears
to me so very unlikely that any young man should form such a design against
a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless, and who was actually
staying in his colonel’s family, that I am strongly inclined to hope the best.
Could he expect that her friends would not step forward? Could he expect to
be noticed again by the regiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster? His
temptation is not adequate to the risk!”
“Do you really think so?” cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a moment.
“Upon my word,” said Mrs. Gardiner, “I begin to be of your uncle’s
opinion. It is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and interest, for
him to be guilty of. I cannot think so very ill of Wickham. Can you yourself,
Lizzy, so wholly give him up, as to believe him capable of it?”
“Not, perhaps, of neglecting his own interest; but of every other neglect I
can believe him capable. If, indeed, it should be so! But I dare not hope it.
Why should they not go on to Scotland if that had been the case?”
“In the first place,” replied Mr. Gardiner, “there is no absolute proof that
they are not gone to Scotland.”
“Oh! but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such a
presumption! And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the Barnet
road.”
“Well, then—supposing them to be in London. They may be there, though
for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptional purpose. It is not
likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it might strike
them that they could be more economically, though less expeditiously, married
in London than in Scotland.”
“But why all this secrecy? Why any fear of detection? Why must their
marriage be private? Oh, no, no—this is not likely. His most particular friend,
you see by Jane’s account, was persuaded of his never intending to marry her.
Wickham will never marry a woman without some money. He cannot afford it.
And what claims has Lydia—what attraction has she beyond youth, health,
and good humour that could make him, for her sake, forego every chance of
benefiting himself by marrying well? As to what restraint the apprehensions of
disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her, I am
not able to judge; for I know nothing of the effects that such a step might
produce. But as to your other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good.
Lydia has no brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father’s
behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to
give to what was going forward in his family, that he would do as little, and
think as little about it, as any father could do, in such a matter.”
“But can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love of him as to
consent to live with him on any terms other than marriage?”
“It does seem, and it is most shocking indeed,” replied Elizabeth, with
tears in her eyes, “that a sister’s sense of decency and virtue in such a point
should admit of doubt. But, really, I know not what to say. Perhaps I am not
doing her justice. But she is very young; she has never been taught to think on
serious subjects; and for the last half-year, nay, for a twelvemonth—she has
been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity. She has been allowed to
dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner, and to adopt any
opinions that came in her way. Since the ——shire were first quartered in
Meryton, nothing but love, flirtation, and officers have been in her head. She
has been doing everything in her power by thinking and talking on the subject,
to give greater—what shall I call it? susceptibility to her feelings; which are
naturally lively enough. And we all know that Wickham has every charm of
person and address that can captivate a woman.”
“But you see that Jane,” said her aunt, “does not think so very ill of
Wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt.”
“Of whom does Jane ever think ill? And who is there, whatever might be
their former conduct, that she would think capable of such an attempt, till it
were proved against them? But Jane knows, as well as I do, what Wickham
really is. We both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word;
that he has neither integrity nor honour; that he is as false and deceitful as he is
insinuating.”
“And do you really know all this?” cried Mrs. Gardiner, whose curiosity as
to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.
“I do indeed,” replied Elizabeth, colouring. “I told you, the other day, of
his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy; and you yourself, when last at
Longbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with
such forbearance and liberality towards him. And there are other
circumstances which I am not at liberty—which it is not worth while to relate;
but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless. From what he said
of Miss Darcy I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud, reserved,
disagreeable girl. Yet he knew to the contrary himself. He must know that she
was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her.”
“But does Lydia know nothing of this? can she be ignorant of what you
and Jane seem so well to understand?”
“Oh, yes!—that, that is the worst of all. Till I was in Kent, and saw so
much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation Colonel Fitzwilliam, I was ignorant
of the truth myself. And when I returned home, the ——shire was to leave
Meryton in a week or fortnight’s time. As that was the case, neither Jane, to
whom I related the whole, nor I, thought it necessary to make our knowledge
public; for of what use could it apparently be to any one, that the good opinion
which all the neighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown? And even
when it was settled that Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster, the necessity of
opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me. That she could be in
any danger from the deception never entered my head. That such a
consequence as this could ensue, you may easily believe, was far enough from
my thoughts.”
“When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no reason, I
suppose, to believe them fond of each other?”
“Not the slightest. I can remember no symptom of affection on either side;
and had anything of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware that ours is
not a family on which it could be thrown away. When first he entered the
corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all were. Every girl in
or near Meryton was out of her senses about him for the first two months; but
he never distinguished her by any particular attention; and, consequently, after
a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration, her fancy for him gave
way, and others of the regiment, who treated her with more distinction, again
became her favourites.”
It may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be added to
their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject, by its repeated
discussion, no other could detain them from it long, during the whole of the
journey. From Elizabeth’s thoughts it was never absent. Fixed there by the
keenest of all anguish, self-reproach, she could find no interval of ease or
forgetfulness.
They travelled as expeditiously as possible, and, sleeping one night on the
road, reached Longbourn by dinner time the next day. It was a comfort to
Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been wearied by long
expectations.
The little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing on the
steps of the house as they entered the paddock; and, when the carriage drove
up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces, and displayed
itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of capers and frisks, was the first
pleasing earnest of their welcome.
Elizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them a hasty kiss, hurried
into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running down from her mother’s
apartment, immediately met her.
Elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the eyes of
both, lost not a moment in asking whether anything had been heard of the
fugitives.
“Not yet,” replied Jane. “But now that my dear uncle is come, I hope
everything will be well.”
“Is my father in town?”
“Yes, he went on Tuesday, as I wrote you word.”
“And have you heard from him often?”
“We have heard only twice. He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday to say
that he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which I particularly
begged him to do. He merely added that he should not write again till he had
something of importance to mention.”
“And my mother—how is she? How are you all?”
“My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are greatly shaken.
She is up stairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all. She does not
yet leave her dressing-room. Mary and Kitty, thank Heaven, are quite well.”
“But you—how are you?” cried Elizabeth. “You look pale. How much you
must have gone through!”
Her sister, however, assured her of her being perfectly well; and their
conversation, which had been passing while Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were
engaged with their children, was now put an end to by the approach of the
whole party. Jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and thanked them
both, with alternate smiles and tears.
When they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which Elizabeth
had already asked were of course repeated by the others, and they soon found
that Jane had no intelligence to give. The sanguine hope of good, however,
which the benevolence of her heart suggested had not yet deserted her; she
still expected that it would all end well, and that every morning would bring
some letter, either from Lydia or her father, to explain their proceedings, and,
perhaps, announce their marriage.
Mrs. Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes’
conversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with tears
and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villainous conduct of
Wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and ill-usage; blaming
everybody but the person to whose ill-judging indulgence the errors of her
daughter must principally be owing.
“If I had been able,” said she, “to carry my point in going to Brighton, with
all my family, this would not have happened; but poor dear Lydia had nobody
to take care of her. Why did the Forsters ever let her go out of their sight? I am
sure there was some great neglect or other on their side, for she is not the kind
of girl to do such a thing if she had been well looked after. I always thought
they were very unfit to have the charge of her; but I was overruled, as I always
am. Poor dear child! And now here’s Mr. Bennet gone away, and I know he
will fight Wickham, wherever he meets him and then he will be killed, and
what is to become of us all? The Collinses will turn us out before he is cold in
his grave, and if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know what we shall
do.”
They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr. Gardiner, after
general assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told her that he
meant to be in London the very next day, and would assist Mr. Bennet in every
endeavour for recovering Lydia.
“Do not give way to useless alarm,” added he; “though it is right to be
prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain. It is not
quite a week since they left Brighton. In a few days more we may gain some
news of them; and till we know that they are not married, and have no design
of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as lost. As soon as I get to town
I shall go to my brother, and make him come home with me to Gracechurch
Street; and then we may consult together as to what is to be done.”
“Oh! my dear brother,” replied Mrs. Bennet, “that is exactly what I could
most wish for. And now do, when you get to town, find them out, wherever
they may be; and if they are not married already, make them marry. And as for
wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but tell Lydia she shall have as
much money as she chooses to buy them, after they are married. And, above
all, keep Mr. Bennet from fighting. Tell him what a dreadful state I am in, that
I am frighted out of my wits—and have such tremblings, such flutterings, all
over me—such spasms in my side and pains in my head, and such beatings at
heart, that I can get no rest by night nor by day. And tell my dear Lydia not to
give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me, for she does not
know which are the best warehouses. Oh, brother, how kind you are! I know
you will contrive it all.”
But Mr. Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in
the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well in her
hopes as her fear; and after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on
the table, they all left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper, who
attended in the absence of her daughters.
Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real
occasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not attempt to oppose
it, for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before
the servants, while they waited at table, and judged it better that one only of
the household, and the one whom they could most trust should comprehend all
her fears and solicitude on the subject.
In the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who had
been too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance
before. One came from her books, and the other from her toilette. The faces of
both, however, were tolerably calm; and no change was visible in either,
except that the loss of her favourite sister, or the anger which she had herself
incurred in this business, had given more of fretfulness than usual to the
accents of Kitty. As for Mary, she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to
Elizabeth, with a countenance of grave reflection, soon after they were seated
at table:
“This is a most unfortunate affair, and will probably be much talked of. But
we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of each
other the balm of sisterly consolation.”
Then, perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added,
“Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw from it this useful
lesson: that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable; that one false step
involves her in endless ruin; that her reputation is no less brittle than it is
beautiful; and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards
the undeserving of the other sex.”
Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed to
make any reply. Mary, however, continued to console herself with such kind of
moral extractions from the evil before them.
In the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for half-anhour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity
of making any inquiries, which Jane was equally eager to satisfy. After joining
in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event, which Elizabeth
considered as all but certain, and Miss Bennet could not assert to be wholly
impossible, the former continued the subject, by saying, “But tell me all and
everything about it which I have not already heard. Give me further
particulars. What did Colonel Forster say? Had they no apprehension of
anything before the elopement took place? They must have seen them together
for ever.”
“Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality,
especially on Lydia’s side, but nothing to give him any alarm. I am so grieved
for him! His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost. He was coming
to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had any idea of their not
being gone to Scotland: when that apprehension first got abroad, it hastened
his journey.”
“And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry? Did he know
of their intending to go off? Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?”
“Yes; but, when questioned by him, Denny denied knowing anything of
their plans, and would not give his real opinion about it. He did not repeat his
persuasion of their not marrying—and from that, I am inclined to hope, he
might have been misunderstood before.”
“And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you entertained a doubt,
I suppose, of their being really married?”
“How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains? I felt a
little uneasy—a little fearful of my sister’s happiness with him in marriage,
because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite right. My father
and mother knew nothing of that; they only felt how imprudent a match it
must be. Kitty then owned, with a very natural triumph on knowing more than
the rest of us, that in Lydia’s last letter she had prepared her for such a step.
She had known, it seems, of their being in love with each other, many weeks.”
“But not before they went to Brighton?”
“No, I believe not.”
“And did Colonel Forster appear to think well of Wickham himself? Does
he know his real character?”
“I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly
did. He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant. And since this sad
affair has taken place, it is said that he left Meryton greatly in debt; but I hope
this may be false.”
“Oh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him, this
could not have happened!”
“Perhaps it would have been better,” replied her sister. “But to expose the
former faults of any person without knowing what their present feelings were,
seemed unjustifiable. We acted with the best intentions.”
“Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia’s note to his wife?”
“He brought it with him for us to see.”
Jane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to Elizabeth. These
were the contents:
“MY DEAR HARRIET,
“You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot help
laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as I am missed. I
am going to Gretna Green, and if you cannot guess with who, I shall think you
a simpleton, for there is but one man in the world I love, and he is an angel. I
should never be happy without him, so think it no harm to be off. You need not
send them word at Longbourn of my going, if you do not like it, for it will
make the surprise the greater, when I write to them and sign my name ‘Lydia
Wickham.’ What a good joke it will be! I can hardly write for laughing. Pray
make my excuses to Pratt for not keeping my engagement, and dancing with
him to-night. Tell him I hope he will excuse me when he knows all; and tell
him I will dance with him at the next ball we meet, with great pleasure. I shall
send for my clothes when I get to Longbourn; but I wish you would tell Sally
to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are packed up.
Good-bye. Give my love to Colonel Forster. I hope you will drink to our good
journey.
“Your affectionate friend,
“LYDIA BENNET.”
“Oh! thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!” cried Elizabeth when she had
finished it. “What a letter is this, to be written at such a moment! But at least it
shows that she was serious on the subject of their journey. Whatever he might
afterwards persuade her to, it was not on her side a scheme of infamy. My
poor father! how he must have felt it!”
“I never saw anyone so shocked. He could not speak a word for full ten
minutes. My mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in such
confusion!”
“Oh! Jane,” cried Elizabeth, “was there a servant belonging to it who did
not know the whole story before the end of the day?”
“I do not know. I hope there was. But to be guarded at such a time is very
difficult. My mother was in hysterics, and though I endeavoured to give her
every assistance in my power, I am afraid I did not do so much as I might have
done! But the horror of what might possibly happen almost took from me my
faculties.”
“Your attendance upon her has been too much for you. You do not look
well. Oh that I had been with you! you have had every care and anxiety upon
yourself alone.”
“Mary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in every
fatigue, I am sure; but I did not think it right for either of them. Kitty is slight
and delicate; and Mary studies so much, that her hours of repose should not be
broken in on. My aunt Phillips came to Longbourn on Tuesday, after my father
went away; and was so good as to stay till Thursday with me. She was of great
use and comfort to us all. And Lady Lucas has been very kind; she walked
here on Wednesday morning to condole with us, and offered her services, or
any of her daughters’, if they should be of use to us.”
“She had better have stayed at home,” cried Elizabeth; “perhaps she meant
well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see too little of one’s
neighbours. Assistance is impossible; condolence insufferable. Let them
triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied.”
She then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her father had
intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his daughter.
“He meant I believe,” replied Jane, “to go to Epsom, the place where they
last changed horses, see the postilions and try if anything could be made out
from them. His principal object must be to discover the number of the hackney
coach which took them from Clapham. It had come with a fare from London;
and as he thought that the circumstance of a gentleman and lady’s removing
from one carriage into another might be remarked he meant to make inquiries
at Clapham. If he could anyhow discover at what house the coachman had
before set down his fare, he determined to make inquiries there, and hoped it
might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach. I do
not know of any other designs that he had formed; but he was in such a hurry
to be gone, and his spirits so greatly discomposed, that I had difficulty in
finding out even so much as this.”
Chapter 48
The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr. Bennet the next
morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from him. His
family knew him to be, on all common occasions, a most negligent and
dilatory correspondent; but at such a time they had hoped for exertion. They
were forced to conclude that he had no pleasing intelligence to send; but even
of that they would have been glad to be certain. Mr. Gardiner had waited only
for the letters before he set off.
When he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant
information of what was going on, and their uncle promised, at parting, to
prevail on Mr. Bennet to return to Longbourn, as soon as he could, to the great
consolation of his sister, who considered it as the only security for her
husband’s not being killed in a duel.
Mrs. Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few days
longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces.
She shared in their attendance on Mrs. Bennet, and was a great comfort to
them in their hours of freedom. Their other aunt also visited them frequently,
and always, as she said, with the design of cheering and heartening them up—
though, as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of
Wickham’s extravagance or irregularity, she seldom went away without
leaving them more dispirited than she found them.
All Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who, but three months
before, had been almost an angel of light. He was declared to be in debt to
every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all honoured with the title of
seduction, had been extended into every tradesman’s family. Everybody
declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world; and everybody
began to find out that they had always distrusted the appearance of his
goodness. Elizabeth, though she did not credit above half of what was said,
believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister’s ruin more
certain; and even Jane, who believed still less of it, became almost hopeless,
more especially as the time was now come when, if they had gone to Scotland,
which she had never before entirely despaired of, they must in all probability
have gained some news of them.
Mr. Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday his wife received a
letter from him; it told them that, on his arrival, he had immediately found out
his brother, and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch Street; that Mr. Bennet
had been to Epsom and Clapham, before his arrival, but without gaining any
satisfactory information; and that he was now determined to inquire at all the
principal hotels in town, as Mr. Bennet thought it possible they might have
gone to one of them, on their first coming to London, before they procured
lodgings. Mr. Gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure,
but as his brother was eager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it. He
added that Mr. Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave London
and promised to write again very soon. There was also a postscript to this
effect:
“I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out, if possible,
from some of the young man’s intimates in the regiment, whether Wickham
has any relations or connections who would be likely to know in what part of
town he has now concealed himself. If there were anyone that one could apply
to with a probability of gaining such a clue as that, it might be of essential
consequence. At present we have nothing to guide us. Colonel Forster will, I
dare say, do everything in his power to satisfy us on this head. But, on second
thoughts, perhaps, Lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living, better
than any other person.”
Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference to her
authority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give any information of so
satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved. She had never heard of his
having had any relations, except a father and mother, both of whom had been
dead many years. It was possible, however, that some of his companions in the
——shire might be able to give more information; and though she was not
very sanguine in expecting it, the application was a something to look forward
to.
Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious
part of each was when the post was expected. The arrival of letters was the
grand object of every morning’s impatience. Through letters, whatever of good
or bad was to be told would be communicated, and every succeeding day was
expected to bring some news of importance.
But before they heard again from Mr. Gardiner, a letter arrived for their
father, from a different quarter, from Mr. Collins; which, as Jane had received
directions to open all that came for him in his absence, she accordingly read;
and Elizabeth, who knew what curiosities his letters always were, looked over
her, and read it likewise. It was as follows:
“MY DEAR SIR,
“I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation in life, to
condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under, of
which we were yesterday informed by a letter from Hertfordshire. Be assured,
my dear sir, that Mrs. Collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you and
all your respectable family, in your present distress, which must be of the
bitterest kind, because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove. No
arguments shall be wanting on my part that can alleviate so severe a
misfortune—or that may comfort you, under a circumstance that must be of all
others the most afflicting to a parent’s mind. The death of your daughter would
have been a blessing in comparison of this. And it is the more to be lamented,
because there is reason to suppose as my dear Charlotte informs me, that this
licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has proceeded from a faulty
degree of indulgence; though, at the same time, for the consolation of yourself
and Mrs. Bennet, I am inclined to think that her own disposition must be
naturally bad, or she could not be guilty of such an enormity, at so early an
age. Howsoever that may be, you are grievously to be pitied; in which opinion
I am not only joined by Mrs. Collins, but likewise by Lady Catherine and her
daughter, to whom I have related the affair. They agree with me in
apprehending that this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the
fortunes of all the others; for who, as Lady Catherine herself condescendingly
says, will connect themselves with such a family? And this consideration leads
me moreover to reflect, with augmented satisfaction, on a certain event of last
November; for had it been otherwise, I must have been involved in all your
sorrow and disgrace. Let me then advise you, dear sir, to console yourself as
much as possible, to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for
ever, and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offense.
“I am, dear sir, etc., etc.”
Mr. Gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer from
Colonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send. It was
not known that Wickham had a single relationship with whom he kept up any
connection, and it was certain that he had no near one living. His former
acquaintances had been numerous; but since he had been in the militia, it did
not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them.
There was no one, therefore, who could be pointed out as likely to give any
news of him. And in the wretched state of his own finances, there was a very
powerful motive for secrecy, in addition to his fear of discovery by Lydia’s
relations, for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to
a very considerable amount. Colonel Forster believed that more than a
thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expenses at Brighton. He
owed a good deal in town, but his debts of honour were still more formidable.
Mr. Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the Longbourn
family. Jane heard them with horror. “A gamester!” she cried. “This is wholly
unexpected. I had not an idea of it.”
Mr. Gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see their father at
home on the following day, which was Saturday. Rendered spiritless by the illsuccess of all their endeavours, he had yielded to his brother-in-law’s entreaty
that he would return to his family, and leave it to him to do whatever occasion
might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit. When Mrs. Bennet
was told of this, she did not express so much satisfaction as her children
expected, considering what her anxiety for his life had been before.
“What, is he coming home, and without poor Lydia?” she cried. “Sure he
will not leave London before he has found them. Who is to fight Wickham,
and make him marry her, if he comes away?”
As Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she and
the children should go to London, at the same time that Mr. Bennet came from
it. The coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their journey, and brought
its master back to Longbourn.
Mrs. Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her
Derbyshire friend that had attended her from that part of the world. His name
had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece; and the kind
of half-expectation which Mrs. Gardiner had formed, of their being followed
by a letter from him, had ended in nothing. Elizabeth had received none since
her return that could come from Pemberley.
The present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for the
lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could be fairly
conjectured from that, though Elizabeth, who was by this time tolerably well
acquainted with her own feelings, was perfectly aware that, had she known
nothing of Darcy, she could have borne the dread of Lydia’s infamy somewhat
better. It would have spared her, she thought, one sleepless night out of two.
When Mr. Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual
philosophic composure. He said as little as he had ever been in the habit of
saying; made no mention of the business that had taken him away, and it was
some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it.
It was not till the afternoon, when he had joined them at tea, that Elizabeth
ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on her briefly expressing her
sorrow for what he must have endured, he replied, “Say nothing of that. Who
should suffer but myself? It has been my own doing, and I ought to feel it.”
“You must not be too severe upon yourself,” replied Elizabeth.
“You may well warn me against such an evil. Human nature is so prone to
fall into it! No, Lizzy, let me once in my life feel how much I have been to
blame. I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression. It will pass
away soon enough.”
“Do you suppose them to be in London?”
“Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?”
“And Lydia used to want to go to London,” added Kitty.
“She is happy then,” said her father drily; “and her residence there will
probably be of some duration.”
Then after a short silence he continued:
“Lizzy, I bear you no ill-will for being justified in your advice to me last
May, which, considering the event, shows some greatness of mind.”
They were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her mother’s
tea.
“This is a parade,” he cried, “which does one good; it gives such an
elegance to misfortune! Another day I will do the same; I will sit in my library,
in my nightcap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble as I can; or,
perhaps, I may defer it till Kitty runs away.”
“I am not going to run away, papa,” said Kitty fretfully. “If I should ever
go to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia.”
“You go to Brighton. I would not trust you so near it as Eastbourne for fifty
pounds! No, Kitty, I have at last learnt to be cautious, and you will feel the
effects of it. No officer is ever to enter into my house again, nor even to pass
through the village. Balls will be absolutely prohibited, unless you stand up
with one of your sisters. And you are never to stir out of doors till you can
prove that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner.”
Kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry.
“Well, well,” said he, “do not make yourself unhappy. If you are a good
girl for the next ten years, I will take you to a review at the end of them.”
Chapter 49
Two days after Mr. Bennet’s return, as Jane and Elizabeth were walking
together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeeper coming
towards them, and, concluding that she came to call them to their mother, went
forward to meet her; but, instead of the expected summons, when they
approached her, she said to Miss Bennet, “I beg your pardon, madam, for
interrupting you, but I was in hopes you might have got some good news from
town, so I took the liberty of coming to ask.”
“What do you mean, Hill? We have heard nothing from town.”
“Dear madam,” cried Mrs. Hill, in great astonishment, “don’t you know
there is an express come for master from Mr. Gardiner? He has been here this
half-hour, and master has had a letter.”
Away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech. They ran
through the vestibule into the breakfast-room; from thence to the library; their
father was in neither; and they were on the point of seeking him up stairs with
their mother, when they were met by the butler, who said:
“If you are looking for my master, ma’am, he is walking towards the little
copse.”
Upon this information, they instantly passed through the hall once more,
and ran across the lawn after their father, who was deliberately pursuing his
way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock.
Jane, who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running as
Elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for breath, came up
with him, and eagerly cried out:
“Oh, papa, what news—what news? Have you heard from my uncle?”
“Yes I have had a letter from him by express.”
“Well, and what news does it bring—good or bad?”
“What is there of good to be expected?” said he, taking the letter from his
pocket. “But perhaps you would like to read it.”
Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand. Jane now came up.
“Read it aloud,” said their father, “for I hardly know myself what it is
about.”
“Gracechurch Street, Monday, August 2.
“MY DEAR BROTHER,
“At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such as, upon
the whole, I hope it will give you satisfaction. Soon after you left me on
Saturday, I was fortunate enough to find out in what part of London they were.
The particulars I reserve till we meet; it is enough to know they are
discovered. I have seen them both—”
“Then it is as I always hoped,” cried Jane; “they are married!”
Elizabeth read on:
“I have seen them both. They are not married, nor can I find there was any
intention of being so; but if you are willing to perform the engagements which
I have ventured to make on your side, I hope it will not be long before they
are. All that is required of you is, to assure to your daughter, by settlement, her
equal share of the five thousand pounds secured among your children after the
decease of yourself and my sister; and, moreover, to enter into an engagement
of allowing her, during your life, one hundred pounds per annum. These are
conditions which, considering everything, I had no hesitation in complying
with, as far as I thought myself privileged, for you. I shall send this by
express, that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer. You will easily
comprehend, from these particulars, that Mr. Wickham’s circumstances are not
so hopeless as they are generally believed to be. The world has been deceived
in that respect; and I am happy to say there will be some little money, even
when all his debts are discharged, to settle on my niece, in addition to her own
fortune. If, as I conclude will be the case, you send me full powers to act in
your name throughout the whole of this business, I will immediately give
directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement. There will not be
the smallest occasion for your coming to town again; therefore stay quiet at
Longbourn, and depend on my diligence and care. Send back your answer as
fast as you can, and be careful to write explicitly. We have judged it best that
my niece should be married from this house, of which I hope you will
approve. She comes to us to-day. I shall write again as soon as anything more
is determined on. Yours, etc.,
“EDW. GARDINER.”
“Is it possible?” cried Elizabeth, when she had finished. “Can it be possible
that he will marry her?”
“Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we thought him,” said her sister.
“My dear father, I congratulate you.”
“And have you answered the letter?” cried Elizabeth.
“No; but it must be done soon.”
Most earnestly did she then entreat him to lose no more time before he
wrote.
“Oh! my dear father,” she cried, “come back and write immediately.
Consider how important every moment is in such a case.”
“Let me write for you,” said Jane, “if you dislike the trouble yourself.”
“I dislike it very much,” he replied; “but it must be done.”
And so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the house.
“And may I ask—” said Elizabeth; “but the terms, I suppose, must be
complied with.”
“Complied with! I am only ashamed of his asking so little.”
“And they must marry! Yet he is such a man!”
“Yes, yes, they must marry. There is nothing else to be done. But there are
two things that I want very much to know; one is, how much money your
uncle has laid down to bring it about; and the other, how am I ever to pay
him.”
“Money! My uncle!” cried Jane, “what do you mean, sir?”
“I mean, that no man in his senses would marry Lydia on so slight a
temptation as one hundred a year during my life, and fifty after I am gone.”
“That is very true,” said Elizabeth; “though it had not occurred to me
before. His debts to be discharged, and something still to remain! Oh! it must
be my uncle’s doings! Generous, good man, I am afraid he has distressed
himself. A small sum could not do all this.”
“No,” said her father; “Wickham’s a fool if he takes her with a farthing less
than ten thousand pounds. I should be sorry to think so ill of him, in the very
beginning of our relationship.”
“Ten thousand pounds! Heaven forbid! How is half such a sum to be
repaid?”
Mr. Bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought, continued
silent till they reached the house. Their father then went on to the library to
write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room.
“And they are really to be married!” cried Elizabeth, as soon as they were
by themselves. “How strange this is! And for this we are to be thankful. That
they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness, and wretched as is his
character, we are forced to rejoice. Oh, Lydia!”
“I comfort myself with thinking,” replied Jane, “that he certainly would not
marry Lydia if he had not a real regard for her. Though our kind uncle has
done something towards clearing him, I cannot believe that ten thousand
pounds, or anything like it, has been advanced. He has children of his own,
and may have more. How could he spare half ten thousand pounds?”
“If he were ever able to learn what Wickham’s debts have been,” said
Elizabeth, “and how much is settled on his side on our sister, we shall exactly
know what Mr. Gardiner has done for them, because Wickham has not
sixpence of his own. The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited.
Their taking her home, and affording her their personal protection and
countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of gratitude cannot
enough acknowledge. By this time she is actually with them! If such goodness
does not make her miserable now, she will never deserve to be happy! What a
meeting for her, when she first sees my aunt!”
“We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side,” said Jane:
“I hope and trust they will yet be happy. His consenting to marry her is a
proof, I will believe, that he is come to a right way of thinking. Their mutual
affection will steady them; and I flatter myself they will settle so quietly, and
live in so rational a manner, as may in time make their past imprudence
forgotten.”
“Their conduct has been such,” replied Elizabeth, “as neither you, nor I,
nor anybody can ever forget. It is useless to talk of it.”
It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly
ignorant of what had happened. They went to the library, therefore, and asked
their father whether he would not wish them to make it known to her. He was
writing and, without raising his head, coolly replied:
“Just as you please.”
“May we take my uncle’s letter to read to her?”
“Take whatever you like, and get away.”
Elizabeth took the letter from his writing-table, and they went up stairs
together. Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs. Bennet: one communication
would, therefore, do for all. After a slight preparation for good news, the letter
was read aloud. Mrs. Bennet could hardly contain herself. As soon as Jane had
read Mr. Gardiner’s hope of Lydia’s being soon married, her joy burst forth,
and every following sentence added to its exuberance. She was now in an
irritation as violent from delight, as she had ever been fidgety from alarm and
vexation. To know that her daughter would be married was enough. She was
disturbed by no fear for her felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her
misconduct.
“My dear, dear Lydia!” she cried. “This is delightful indeed! She will be
married! I shall see her again! She will be married at sixteen! My good, kind
brother! I knew how it would be. I knew he would manage everything! How I
long to see her! and to see dear Wickham too! But the clothes, the wedding
clothes! I will write to my sister Gardiner about them directly. Lizzy, my dear,
run down to your father, and ask him how much he will give her. Stay, stay, I
will go myself. Ring the bell, Kitty, for Hill. I will put on my things in a
moment. My dear, dear Lydia! How merry we shall be together when we
meet!”
Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of
these transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr.
Gardiner’s behaviour laid them all under.
“For we must attribute this happy conclusion,” she added, “in a great
measure to his kindness. We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to
assist Mr. Wickham with money.”
“Well,” cried her mother, “it is all very right; who should do it but her own
uncle? If he had not had a family of his own, I and my children must have had
all his money, you know; and it is the first time we have ever had anything
from him, except a few presents. Well! I am so happy! In a short time I shall
have a daughter married. Mrs. Wickham! How well it sounds! And she was
only sixteen last June. My dear Jane, I am in such a flutter, that I am sure I
can’t write; so I will dictate, and you write for me. We will settle with your
father about the money afterwards; but the things should be ordered
immediately.”
She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and
cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had not
Jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait till her father was at
leisure to be consulted. One day’s delay, she observed, would be of small
importance; and her mother was too happy to be quite so obstinate as usual.
Other schemes, too, came into her head.
“I will go to Meryton,” said she, “as soon as I am dressed, and tell the
good, good news to my sister Philips. And as I come back, I can call on Lady
Lucas and Mrs. Long. Kitty, run down and order the carriage. An airing would
do me a great deal of good, I am sure. Girls, can I do anything for you in
Meryton? Oh! Here comes Hill! My dear Hill, have you heard the good news?
Miss Lydia is going to be married; and you shall all have a bowl of punch to
make merry at her wedding.”
Mrs. Hill began instantly to express her joy. Elizabeth received her
congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took refuge in her
own room, that she might think with freedom.
Poor Lydia’s situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was no
worse, she had need to be thankful. She felt it so; and though, in looking
forward, neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity could be justly
expected for her sister, in looking back to what they had feared, only two
hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they had gained.
Chapter 50
Mr. Bennet had very often wished before this period of his life that, instead
of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum for the better
provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived him. He now wished
it more than ever. Had he done his duty in that respect, Lydia need not have
been indebted to her uncle for whatever of honour or credit could now be
purchased for her. The satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless
young men in Great Britain to be her husband might then have rested in its
proper place.
He was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to anyone
should be forwarded at the sole expense of his brother-in-law, and he was
determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his assistance, and to
discharge the obligation as soon as he could.
When first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly
useless, for, of course, they were to have a son. The son was to join in cutting
off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow and younger
children would by that means be provided for. Five daughters successively
entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs. Bennet, for many
years after Lydia’s birth, had been certain that he would. This event had at last
been despaired of, but it was then too late to be saving. Mrs. Bennet had no
turn for economy, and her husband’s love of independence had alone
prevented their exceeding their income.
Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs. Bennet and
the children. But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter
depended on the will of the parents. This was one point, with regard to Lydia,
at least, which was now to be settled, and Mr. Bennet could have no hesitation
in acceding to the proposal before him. In terms of grateful acknowledgment
for the kindness of his brother, though expressed most concisely, he then
delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done, and his
willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him. He had
never before supposed that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his
daughter, it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the
present arrangement. He would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser by the
hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket
allowance, and the continual presents in money which passed to her through
her mother’s hands, Lydia’s expenses had been very little within that sum.
That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was
another very welcome surprise; for his wish at present was to have as little
trouble in the business as possible. When the first transports of rage which had
produced his activity in seeking her were over, he naturally returned to all his
former indolence. His letter was soon dispatched; for, though dilatory in
undertaking business, he was quick in its execution. He begged to know
further particulars of what he was indebted to his brother, but was too angry
with Lydia to send any message to her.
The good news spread quickly through the house, and with proportionate
speed through the neighbourhood. It was borne in the latter with decent
philosophy. To be sure, it would have been more for the advantage of
conversation had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town; or, as the happiest
alternative, been secluded from the world, in some distant farmhouse. But
there was much to be talked of in marrying her; and the good-natured wishes
for her well-doing which had proceeded before from all the spiteful old ladies
in Meryton lost but a little of their spirit in this change of circumstances,
because with such an husband her misery was considered certain.
It was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been downstairs; but on this
happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in spirits
oppressively high. No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph. The
marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object of her wishes since
Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of accomplishment, and her thoughts
and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins,
new carriages, and servants. She was busily searching through the
neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter, and, without knowing
or considering what their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size
and importance.
“Haye Park might do,” said she, “if the Gouldings could quit it—or the
great house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but Ashworth is too far
off! I could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for Pulvis Lodge,
the attics are dreadful.”
Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the servants
remained. But when they had withdrawn, he said to her: “Mrs. Bennet, before
you take any or all of these houses for your son and daughter, let us come to a
right understanding. Into one house in this neighbourhood they shall never
have admittance. I will not encourage the impudence of either, by receiving
them at Longbourn.”
A long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr. Bennet was firm. It soon
led to another; and Mrs. Bennet found, with amazement and horror, that her
husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter. He
protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever on
the occasion. Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend it. That his anger could be
carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment as to refuse his daughter a
privilege without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all
she could believe possible. She was more alive to the disgrace which her want
of new clothes must reflect on her daughter’s nuptials, than to any sense of
shame at her eloping and living with Wickham a fortnight before they took
place.
Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of the
moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister;
for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the
elopement, they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning from all
those who were not immediately on the spot.
She had no fear of its spreading farther through his means. There were few
people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended; but, at
the same time, there was no one whose knowledge of a sister’s frailty would
have mortified her so much—not, however, from any fear of disadvantage
from it individually to herself, for, at any rate, there seemed a gulf impassable
between them. Had Lydia’s marriage been concluded on the most honourable
terms, it was not to be supposed that Mr. Darcy would connect himself with a
family where, to every other objection, would now be added an alliance and
relationship of the nearest kind with a man whom he so justly scorned.
From such a connection she could not wonder that he would shrink. The
wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his feeling in
Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this. She
was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she hardly knew of what.
She became jealous of his esteem, when she could no longer hope to be
benefited by it. She wanted to hear of him, when there seemed the least chance
of gaining intelligence. She was convinced that she could have been happy
with him, when it was no longer likely they should meet.
What a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that the
proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago, would now
have been most gladly and gratefully received! He was as generous, she
doubted not, as the most generous of his sex; but while he was mortal, there
must be a triumph.
She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who, in
disposition and talents, would most suit her. His understanding and temper,
though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes. It was an union
that must have been to the advantage of both; by her ease and liveliness, his
mind might have been softened, his manners improved; and from his
judgement, information, and knowledge of the world, she must have received
benefit of greater importance.
But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what
connubial felicity really was. An union of a different tendency, and precluding
the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their family.
How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence,
she could not imagine. But how little of permanent happiness could belong to
a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger
than their virtue, she could easily conjecture.
Mr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother. To Mr. Bennet’s
acknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurance of his eagerness to
promote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with entreaties that
the subject might never be mentioned to him again. The principal purport of
his letter was to inform them that Mr. Wickham had resolved on quitting the
militia.
“It was greatly my wish that he should do so,” he added, “as soon as his
marriage was fixed on. And I think you will agree with me, in considering the
removal from that corps as highly advisable, both on his account and my
niece’s. It is Mr. Wickham’s intention to go into the regulars; and among his
former friends, there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in
the army. He has the promise of an ensigncy in General ——‘s regiment, now
quartered in the North. It is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the
kingdom. He promises fairly; and I hope among different people, where they
may each have a character to preserve, they will both be more prudent. I have
written to Colonel Forster, to inform him of our present arrangements, and to
request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr. Wickham in and near
Brighton, with assurances of speedy payment, for which I have pledged
myself. And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances
to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin a list according to his
information? He has given in all his debts; I hope at least he has not deceived
us. Haggerston has our directions, and all will be completed in a week. They
will then join his regiment, unless they are first invited to Longbourn; and I
understand from Mrs. Gardiner, that my niece is very desirous of seeing you
all before she leaves the South. She is well, and begs to be dutifully
remembered to you and her mother.—Yours, etc.,
“E. GARDINER.”
Mr. Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham’s
removal from the ——shire as clearly as Mr. Gardiner could do. But Mrs.
Bennet was not so well pleased with it. Lydia’s being settled in the North, just
when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company, for she had
by no means given up her plan of their residing in Hertfordshire, was a severe
disappointment; and, besides, it was such a pity that Lydia should be taken
from a regiment where she was acquainted with everybody, and had so many
favourites.
“She is so fond of Mrs. Forster,” said she, “it will be quite shocking to send
her away! And there are several of the young men, too, that she likes very
much. The officers may not be so pleasant in General ——‘s regiment.”
His daughter’s request, for such it might be considered, of being admitted
into her family again before she set off for the North, received at first an
absolute negative. But Jane and Elizabeth, who agreed in wishing, for the sake
of their sister’s feelings and consequence, that she should be noticed on her
marriage by her parents, urged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so mildly,
to receive her and her husband at Longbourn, as soon as they were married,
that he was prevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished. And
their mother had the satisfaction of knowing that she would be able to show
her married daughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to the
North. When Mr. Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he sent his
permission for them to come; and it was settled, that as soon as the ceremony
was over, they should proceed to Longbourn. Elizabeth was surprised,
however, that Wickham should consent to such a scheme, and had she
consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with him would have been
the last object of her wishes.
Chapter 51
Their sister’s wedding day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her
probably more than she felt for herself. The carriage was sent to meet them at
——, and they were to return in it by dinner-time. Their arrival was dreaded
by the elder Miss Bennets, and Jane more especially, who gave Lydia the
feelings which would have attended herself, had she been the culprit, and was
wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure.
They came. The family were assembled in the breakfast room to receive
them. Smiles decked the face of Mrs. Bennet as the carriage drove up to the
door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed,
anxious, uneasy.
Lydia’s voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and
she ran into the room. Her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and
welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand, with an affectionate smile, to
Wickham, who followed his lady; and wished them both joy with an alacrity
which shewed no doubt of their happiness.
Their reception from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite
so cordial. His countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely opened
his lips. The easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was enough to
provoke him. Elizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet was shocked.
Lydia was Lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and fearless. She
turned from sister to sister, demanding their congratulations; and when at
length they all sat down, looked eagerly round the room, took notice of some
little alteration in it, and observed, with a laugh, that it was a great while since
she had been there.
Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his manners were
always so pleasing, that had his character and his marriage been exactly what
they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he claimed their
relationship, would have delighted them all. Elizabeth had not before believed
him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat down, resolving within herself
to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man. She blushed,
and Jane blushed; but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion
suffered no variation of colour.
There was no want of discourse. The bride and her mother could neither of
them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to sit near Elizabeth,
began inquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood, with a good
humoured ease which she felt very unable to equal in her replies. They seemed
each of them to have the happiest memories in the world. Nothing of the past
was recollected with pain; and Lydia led voluntarily to subjects which her
sisters would not have alluded to for the world.
“Only think of its being three months,” she cried, “since I went away; it
seems but a fortnight I declare; and yet there have been things enough
happened in the time. Good gracious! when I went away, I am sure I had no
more idea of being married till I came back again! though I thought it would
be very good fun if I was.”
Her father lifted up his eyes. Jane was distressed. Elizabeth looked
expressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw anything of which she
chose to be insensible, gaily continued, “Oh! mamma, do the people
hereabouts know I am married to-day? I was afraid they might not; and we
overtook William Goulding in his curricle, so I was determined he should
know it, and so I let down the side-glass next to him, and took off my glove,
and let my hand just rest upon the window frame, so that he might see the ring,
and then I bowed and smiled like anything.”
Elizabeth could bear it no longer. She got up, and ran out of the room; and
returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining
parlour. She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia, with anxious parade,
walk up to her mother’s right hand, and hear her say to her eldest sister, “Ah!
Jane, I take your place now, and you must go lower, because I am a married
woman.”
It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment
from which she had been so wholly free at first. Her ease and good spirits
increased. She longed to see Mrs. Phillips, the Lucases, and all their other
neighbours, and to hear herself called “Mrs. Wickham” by each of them; and
in the mean time, she went after dinner to show her ring, and boast of being
married, to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids.
“Well, mamma,” said she, when they were all returned to the breakfast
room, “and what do you think of my husband? Is not he a charming man? I am
sure my sisters must all envy me. I only hope they may have half my good
luck. They must all go to Brighton. That is the place to get husbands. What a
pity it is, mamma, we did not all go.”
“Very true; and if I had my will, we should. But my dear Lydia, I don’t at
all like your going such a way off. Must it be so?”
“Oh, lord! yes;—there is nothing in that. I shall like it of all things. You
and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us. We shall be at
Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be some balls, and I will
take care to get good partners for them all.”
“I should like it beyond anything!” said her mother.
“And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters
behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the winter is
over.”
“I thank you for my share of the favour,” said Elizabeth; “but I do not
particularly like your way of getting husbands.”
Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them. Mr. Wickham
had received his commission before he left London, and he was to join his
regiment at the end of a fortnight.
No one but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their stay would be so short; and she
made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter, and having very
frequent parties at home. These parties were acceptable to all; to avoid a
family circle was even more desirable to such as did think, than such as did
not.
Wickham’s affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had expected to
find it; not equal to Lydia’s for him. She had scarcely needed her present
observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that their elopement had
been brought on by the strength of her love, rather than by his; and she would
have wondered why, without violently caring for her, he chose to elope with
her at all, had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by
distress of circumstances; and if that were the case, he was not the young man
to resist an opportunity of having a companion.
Lydia was exceedingly fond of him. He was her dear Wickham on every
occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him. He did every thing
best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of
September, than any body else in the country.
One morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two elder
sisters, she said to Elizabeth:
“Lizzy, I never gave you an account of my wedding, I believe. You were
not by, when I told mamma and the others all about it. Are not you curious to
hear how it was managed?”
“No really,” replied Elizabeth; “I think there cannot be too little said on the
subject.”
“La! You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went off. We were
married, you know, at St. Clement’s, because Wickham’s lodgings were in that
parish. And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o’clock. My
uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the others were to meet us at the
church. Well, Monday morning came, and I was in such a fuss! I was so afraid,
you know, that something would happen to put it off, and then I should have
gone quite distracted. And there was my aunt, all the time I was dressing,
preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon. However, I
did not hear above one word in ten, for I was thinking, you may suppose, of
my dear Wickham. I longed to know whether he would be married in his blue
coat.”
“Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it would never be
over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my uncle and aunt were
horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them. If you’ll believe me, I did not
once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a fortnight. Not one party, or
scheme, or anything. To be sure London was rather thin, but, however, the
Little Theatre was open. Well, and so just as the carriage came to the door, my
uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man Mr. Stone. And then,
you know, when once they get together, there is no end of it. Well, I was so
frightened I did not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and
if we were beyond the hour, we could not be married all day. But, luckily, he
came back again in ten minutes’ time, and then we all set out. However, I
recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going, the wedding need
not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done as well.”
“Mr. Darcy!” repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement.
“Oh, yes!—he was to come there with Wickham, you know. But gracious
me! I quite forgot! I ought not to have said a word about it. I promised them so
faithfully! What will Wickham say? It was to be such a secret!”
“If it was to be secret,” said Jane, “say not another word on the subject.
You may depend upon my seeking no further.”
“Oh! certainly,” said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; “we will
ask you no questions.”
“Thank you,” said Lydia, “for if you did, I should certainly tell you all, and
then Wickham would be angry.”
On such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her
power, by running away.
But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least it was
impossible not to try for information. Mr. Darcy had been at her sister’s
wedding. It was exactly a scene, and exactly among people, where he had
apparently least to do, and least temptation to go. Conjectures as to the
meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her brain; but she was satisfied with
none. Those that best pleased her, as placing his conduct in the noblest light,
seemed most improbable. She could not bear such suspense; and hastily
seizing a sheet of paper, wrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an
explanation of what Lydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy
which had been intended.
“You may readily comprehend,” she added, “what my curiosity must be to
know how a person unconnected with any of us, and (comparatively speaking)
a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such a time. Pray
write instantly, and let me understand it—unless it is, for very cogent reasons,
to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to think necessary; and then I
must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance.”
“Not that I shall, though,” she added to herself, as she finished the letter;
“and my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in an honourable manner, I shall
certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out.”
Jane’s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to Elizabeth
privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was glad of it;—till it appeared
whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction, she had rather be without
a confidante.
Chapter 52
Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as soon
as she possibly could. She was no sooner in possession of it than, hurrying into
the little copse, where she was least likely to be interrupted, she sat down on
one of the benches and prepared to be happy; for the length of the letter
convinced her that it did not contain a denial.
“Gracechurch street, Sept. 6.
“MY DEAR NIECE,
“I have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole morning to
answering it, as I foresee that a little writing will not comprise what I have to
tell you. I must confess myself surprised by your application; I did not expect
it from you. Don’t think me angry, however, for I only mean to let you know
that I had not imagined such inquiries to be necessary on your side. If you do
not choose to understand me, forgive my impertinence. Your uncle is as much
surprised as I am—and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned
would have allowed him to act as he has done. But if you are really innocent
and ignorant, I must be more explicit.
“On the very day of my coming home from Longbourn, your uncle had a
most unexpected visitor. Mr. Darcy called, and was shut up with him several
hours. It was all over before I arrived; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully
racked as yours seems to have been. He came to tell Mr. Gardiner that he had
found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham were, and that he had seen and
talked with them both; Wickham repeatedly, Lydia once. From what I can
collect, he left Derbyshire only one day after ourselves, and came to town with
the resolution of hunting for them. The motive professed was his conviction of
its being owing to himself that Wickham’s worthlessness had not been so well
known as to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or
confide in him. He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride, and
confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private actions
open to the world. His character was to speak for itself. He called it, therefore,
his duty to step forward, and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been
brought on by himself. If he had another motive, I am sure it would never
disgrace him. He had been some days in town, before he was able to discover
them; but he had something to direct his search, which was more than we had;
and the consciousness of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us.
“There is a lady, it seems, a Mrs. Younge, who was some time ago
governess to Miss Darcy, and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of
disapprobation, though he did not say what. She then took a large house in
Edward-street, and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings. This Mrs.
Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with Wickham; and he went to
her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to town. But it was two or three
days before he could get from her what he wanted. She would not betray her
trust, I suppose, without bribery and corruption, for she really did know where
her friend was to be found. Wickham indeed had gone to her on their first
arrival in London, and had she been able to receive them into her house, they
would have taken up their abode with her. At length, however, our kind friend
procured the wished-for direction. They were in —— street. He saw
Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia. His first object with her, he
acknowledged, had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful
situation, and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to
receive her, offering his assistance, as far as it would go. But he found Lydia
absolutely resolved on remaining where she was. She cared for none of her
friends; she wanted no help of his; she would not hear of leaving Wickham.
She was sure they should be married some time or other, and it did not much
signify when. Since such were her feelings, it only remained, he thought, to
secure and expedite a marriage, which, in his very first conversation with
Wickham, he easily learnt had never been his design. He confessed himself
obliged to leave the regiment, on account of some debts of honour, which were
very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the ill-consequences of Lydia’s flight
on her own folly alone. He meant to resign his commission immediately; and
as to his future situation, he could conjecture very little about it. He must go
somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should have nothing
to live on.
“Mr. Darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once. Though
Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have been able to do
something for him, and his situation must have been benefited by marriage.
But he found, in reply to this question, that Wickham still cherished the hope
of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in some other country.
Under such circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof against the
temptation of immediate relief.
“They met several times, for there was much to be discussed. Wickham of
course wanted more than he could get; but at length was reduced to be
reasonable.
“Every thing being settled between them, Mr. Darcy’s next step was to
make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in Gracechurch street
the evening before I came home. But Mr. Gardiner could not be seen, and Mr.
Darcy found, on further inquiry, that your father was still with him, but would
quit town the next morning. He did not judge your father to be a person whom
he could so properly consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed
seeing him till after the departure of the former. He did not leave his name,
and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called on
business.
“On Saturday he came again. Your father was gone, your uncle at home,
and, as I said before, they had a great deal of talk together.
“They met again on Sunday, and then I saw him too. It was not all settled
before Monday: as soon as it was, the express was sent off to Longbourn. But
our visitor was very obstinate. I fancy, Lizzy, that obstinacy is the real defect
of his character, after all. He has been accused of many faults at different
times, but this is the true one. Nothing was to be done that he did not do
himself; though I am sure (and I do not speak it to be thanked, therefore say
nothing about it), your uncle would most readily have settled the whole.
“They battled it together for a long time, which was more than either the
gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved. But at last your uncle was forced
to yield, and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece, was forced to
put up with only having the probable credit of it, which went sorely against the
grain; and I really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure,
because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed
feathers, and give the praise where it was due. But, Lizzy, this must go no
farther than yourself, or Jane at most.
“You know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done for the young
people. His debts are to be paid, amounting, I believe, to considerably more
than a thousand pounds, another thousand in addition to her own settled upon
her, and his commission purchased. The reason why all this was to be done by
him alone, was such as I have given above. It was owing to him, to his reserve
and want of proper consideration, that Wickham’s character had been so
misunderstood, and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he
was. Perhaps there was some truth in this; though I doubt whether his reserve,
or anybody’s reserve, can be answerable for the event. But in spite of all this
fine talking, my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle
would never have yielded, if we had not given him credit for another interest
in the affair.
“When all this was resolved on, he returned again to his friends, who were
still staying at Pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in London once
more when the wedding took place, and all money matters were then to
receive the last finish.
“I believe I have now told you every thing. It is a relation which you tell
me is to give you great surprise; I hope at least it will not afford you any
displeasure. Lydia came to us; and Wickham had constant admission to the
house. He was exactly what he had been, when I knew him in Hertfordshire;
but I would not tell you how little I was satisfied with her behaviour while she
staid with us, if I had not perceived, by Jane’s letter last Wednesday, that her
conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it, and therefore what I
now tell you can give you no fresh pain. I talked to her repeatedly in the most
serious manner, representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done,
and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family. If she heard me, it was
by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen. I was sometimes quite provoked,
but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and Jane, and for their sakes had
patience with her.
“Mr. Darcy was punctual in his return, and as Lydia informed you,
attended the wedding. He dined with us the next day, and was to leave town
again on Wednesday or Thursday. Will you be very angry with me, my dear
Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold enough to say
before) how much I like him. His behaviour to us has, in every respect, been
as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire. His understanding and opinions
all please me; he wants nothing but a little more liveliness, and that, if he
marry prudently, his wife may teach him. I thought him very sly;—he hardly
ever mentioned your name. But slyness seems the fashion.
“Pray forgive me if I have been very presuming, or at least do not punish
me so far as to exclude me from P. I shall never be quite happy till I have been
all round the park. A low phaeton, with a nice little pair of ponies, would be
the very thing.
“But I must write no more. The children have been wanting me this half
hour.
“Yours, very sincerely,
“M. GARDINER.”
The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits, in which
it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share.
The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what
Mr. Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister’s match, which she had
feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable, and at
the same time dreaded to be just, from the pain of obligation, were proved
beyond their greatest extent to be true! He had followed them purposely to
town, he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on
such a research; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom
he must abominate and despise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently
meet, reason with, persuade, and finally bribe, the man whom he always most
wished to avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to
pronounce. He had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor
esteem. Her heart did whisper that he had done it for her. But it was a hope
shortly checked by other considerations, and she soon felt that even her vanity
was insufficient, when required to depend on his affection for her—for a
woman who had already refused him—as able to overcome a sentiment so
natural as abhorrence against relationship with Wickham. Brother-in-law of
Wickham! Every kind of pride must revolt from the connection. He had, to be
sure, done much. She was ashamed to think how much. But he had given a
reason for his interference, which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief. It
was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong; he had liberality, and
he had the means of exercising it; and though she would not place herself as
his principal inducement, she could, perhaps, believe that remaining partiality
for her might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must
be materially concerned. It was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that they
were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return. They
owed the restoration of Lydia, her character, every thing, to him. Oh! how
heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever
encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him. For
herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him. Proud that in a cause of
compassion and honour, he had been able to get the better of himself. She read
over her aunt’s commendation of him again and again. It was hardly enough;
but it pleased her. She was even sensible of some pleasure, though mixed with
regret, on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded
that affection and confidence subsisted between Mr. Darcy and herself.
She was roused from her seat, and her reflections, by some one’s approach;
and before she could strike into another path, she was overtaken by Wickham.
“I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?” said he, as he
joined her.
“You certainly do,” she replied with a smile; “but it does not follow that
the interruption must be unwelcome.”
“I should be sorry indeed, if it were. We were always good friends; and
now we are better.”
“True. Are the others coming out?”
“I do not know. Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to
Meryton. And so, my dear sister, I find, from our uncle and aunt, that you have
actually seen Pemberley.”
She replied in the affirmative.
“I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be too much for
me, or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle. And you saw the old
housekeeper, I suppose? Poor Reynolds, she was always very fond of me. But
of course she did not mention my name to you.”
“Yes, she did.”
“And what did she say?”
“That you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had—not turned out
well. At such a distance as that, you know, things are strangely
misrepresented.”
“Certainly,” he replied, biting his lips. Elizabeth hoped she had silenced
him; but he soon afterwards said:
“I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month. We passed each other
several times. I wonder what he can be doing there.”
“Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh,” said Elizabeth.
“It must be something particular, to take him there at this time of year.”
“Undoubtedly. Did you see him while you were at Lambton? I thought I
understood from the Gardiners that you had.”
“Yes; he introduced us to his sister.”
“And do you like her?”
“Very much.”
“I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year
or two. When I last saw her, she was not very promising. I am very glad you
liked her. I hope she will turn out well.”
“I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age.”
“Did you go by the village of Kympton?”
“I do not recollect that we did.”
“I mention it, because it is the living which I ought to have had. A most
delightful place!—Excellent Parsonage House! It would have suited me in
every respect.”
“How should you have liked making sermons?”
“Exceedingly well. I should have considered it as part of my duty, and the
exertion would soon have been nothing. One ought not to repine;—but, to be
sure, it would have been such a thing for me! The quiet, the retirement of such
a life would have answered all my ideas of happiness! But it was not to be.
Did you ever hear Darcy mention the circumstance, when you were in Kent?”
“I have heard from authority, which I thought as good, that it was left you
conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron.”
“You have. Yes, there was something in that; I told you so from the first,
you may remember.”
“I did hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making was not so
palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually declared your
resolution of never taking orders, and that the business had been compromised
accordingly.”
“You did! and it was not wholly without foundation. You may remember
what I told you on that point, when first we talked of it.”
They were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked fast to
get rid of him; and unwilling, for her sister’s sake, to provoke him, she only
said in reply, with a good-humoured smile:
“Come, Mr. Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know. Do not let us
quarrel about the past. In future, I hope we shall be always of one mind.”
She held out her hand; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry, though he
hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house.
Chapter 53
Mr. Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation that he
never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth, by
introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to find that she had said
enough to keep him quiet.
The day of his and Lydia’s departure soon came, and Mrs. Bennet was
forced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no means entered
into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle, was likely to continue at least
a twelvemonth.
“Oh! my dear Lydia,” she cried, “when shall we meet again?”
“Oh, lord! I don’t know. Not these two or three years, perhaps.”
“Write to me very often, my dear.”
“As often as I can. But you know married women have never much time
for writing. My sisters may write to me. They will have nothing else to do.”
Mr. Wickham’s adieus were much more affectionate than his wife’s. He
smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.
“He is as fine a fellow,” said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they were out of the
house, “as ever I saw. He simpers, and smirks, and makes love to us all. I am
prodigiously proud of him. I defy even Sir William Lucas himself to produce a
more valuable son-in-law.”
The loss of her daughter made Mrs. Bennet very dull for several days.
“I often think,” said she, “that there is nothing so bad as parting with one’s
friends. One seems so forlorn without them.”
“This is the consequence, you see, Madam, of marrying a daughter,” said
Elizabeth. “It must make you better satisfied that your other four are single.”
“It is no such thing. Lydia does not leave me because she is married, but
only because her husband’s regiment happens to be so far off. If that had been
nearer, she would not have gone so soon.”
But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly
relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by an article of
news which then began to be in circulation. The housekeeper at Netherfield
had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master, who was coming
down in a day or two, to shoot there for several weeks. Mrs. Bennet was quite
in the fidgets. She looked at Jane, and smiled and shook her head by turns.
“Well, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister,” (for Mrs. Phillips
first brought her the news). “Well, so much the better. Not that I care about it,
though. He is nothing to us, you know, and I am sure I never want to see him
again. But, however, he is very welcome to come to Netherfield, if he likes it.
And who knows what may happen? But that is nothing to us. You know, sister,
we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it. And so, is it quite
certain he is coming?”
“You may depend on it,” replied the other, “for Mrs. Nicholls was in
Meryton last night; I saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose to
know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certain true. He comes down
on Thursday at the latest, very likely on Wednesday. She was going to the
butcher’s, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on Wednesday, and
she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed.”
Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing
colour. It was many months since she had mentioned his name to Elizabeth;
but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said:
“I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present
report; and I know I appeared distressed. But don’t imagine it was from any
silly cause. I was only confused for the moment, because I felt that I should be
looked at. I do assure you that the news does not affect me either with pleasure
or pain. I am glad of one thing, that he comes alone; because we shall see the
less of him. Not that I am afraid of myself, but I dread other people’s
remarks.”
Elizabeth did not know what to make of it. Had she not seen him in
Derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no
other view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial to
Jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there with
his friend’s permission, or being bold enough to come without it.
“Yet it is hard,” she sometimes thought, “that this poor man cannot come
to a house which he has legally hired, without raising all this speculation! I
will leave him to himself.”
In spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her feelings in
the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits
were affected by it. They were more disturbed, more unequal, than she had
often seen them.
The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents,
about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.
“As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear,” said Mrs. Bennet, “you
will wait on him of course.”
“No, no. You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised, if I went
to see him, he should marry one of my daughters. But it ended in nothing, and
I will not be sent on a fool’s errand again.”
His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention
would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to Netherfield.
“‘Tis an etiquette I despise,” said he. “If he wants our society, let him seek
it. He knows where we live. I will not spend my hours in running after my
neighbours every time they go away and come back again.”
“Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on
him. But, however, that shan’t prevent my asking him to dine here, I am
determined. We must have Mrs. Long and the Gouldings soon. That will make
thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at table for him.”
Consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her husband’s
incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all
see Mr. Bingley, in consequence of it, before they did. As the day of his arrival
drew near,—
“I begin to be sorry that he comes at all,” said Jane to her sister. “It would
be nothing; I could see him with perfect indifference, but I can hardly bear to
hear it thus perpetually talked of. My mother means well; but she does not
know, no one can know, how much I suffer from what she says. Happy shall I
be, when his stay at Netherfield is over!”
“I wish I could say anything to comfort you,” replied Elizabeth; “but it is
wholly out of my power. You must feel it; and the usual satisfaction of
preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because you have always so
much.”
Mr. Bingley arrived. Mrs. Bennet, through the assistance of servants,
contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety and
fretfulness on her side might be as long as it could. She counted the days that
must intervene before their invitation could be sent; hopeless of seeing him
before. But on the third morning after his arrival in Hertfordshire, she saw
him, from her dressing-room window, enter the paddock and ride towards the
house.
Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy. Jane resolutely
kept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went to the
window—she looked,—she saw Mr. Darcy with him, and sat down again by
her sister.
“There is a gentleman with him, mamma,” said Kitty; “who can it be?”
“Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not
know.”
“La!” replied Kitty, “it looks just like that man that used to be with him
before. Mr. what’s-his-name. That tall, proud man.”
“Good gracious! Mr. Darcy!—and so it does, I vow. Well, any friend of
Mr. Bingley’s will always be welcome here, to be sure; but else I must say that
I hate the very sight of him.”
Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern. She knew but little of
their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness which
must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his
explanatory letter. Both sisters were uncomfortable enough. Each felt for the
other, and of course for themselves; and their mother talked on, of her dislike
of Mr. Darcy, and her resolution to be civil to him only as Mr. Bingley’s
friend, without being heard by either of them. But Elizabeth had sources of
uneasiness which could not be suspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet
had courage to shew Mrs. Gardiner’s letter, or to relate her own change of
sentiment towards him. To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she
had refused, and whose merit she had undervalued; but to her own more
extensive information, he was the person to whom the whole family were
indebted for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an
interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just as what Jane felt
for Bingley. Her astonishment at his coming—at his coming to Netherfield, to
Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again, was almost equal to what she
had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in Derbyshire.
The colour which had been driven from her face, returned for half a minute
with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes, as she
thought for that space of time that his affection and wishes must still be
unshaken. But she would not be secure.
“Let me first see how he behaves,” said she; “it will then be early enough
for expectation.”
She sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to lift
up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister as the
servant was approaching the door. Jane looked a little paler than usual, but
more sedate than Elizabeth had expected. On the gentlemen’s appearing, her
colour increased; yet she received them with tolerable ease, and with a
propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment or any
unnecessary complaisance.
Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down again
to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command. She had
ventured only one glance at Darcy. He looked serious, as usual; and, she
thought, more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, than as she had
seen him at Pemberley. But, perhaps he could not in her mother’s presence be
what he was before her uncle and aunt. It was a painful, but not an improbable,
conjecture.
Bingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period saw
him looking both pleased and embarrassed. He was received by Mrs. Bennet
with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed, especially
when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and
address to his friend.
Elizabeth, particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter the
preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy, was hurt and
distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied.
Darcy, after inquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did, a question
which she could not answer without confusion, said scarcely anything. He was
not seated by her; perhaps that was the reason of his silence; but it had not
been so in Derbyshire. There he had talked to her friends, when he could not
to herself. But now several minutes elapsed without bringing the sound of his
voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist the impulse of curiosity, she
raised her eyes to his face, she as often found him looking at Jane as at herself,
and frequently on no object but the ground. More thoughtfulness and less
anxiety to please, than when they last met, were plainly expressed. She was
disappointed, and angry with herself for being so.
“Could I expect it to be otherwise!” said she. “Yet why did he come?”
She was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself; and to
him she had hardly courage to speak.
She inquired after his sister, but could do no more.
“It is a long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away,” said Mrs. Bennet.
He readily agreed to it.
“I began to be afraid you would never come back again. People did say
you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope it is
not true. A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood, since
you went away. Miss Lucas is married and settled. And one of my own
daughters. I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have seen it in the
papers. It was in The Times and The Courier, I know; though it was not put in
as it ought to be. It was only said, ‘Lately, George Wickham, Esq. to Miss
Lydia Bennet,’ without there being a syllable said of her father, or the place
where she lived, or anything. It was my brother Gardiner’s drawing up too,
and I wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it. Did you
see it?”
Bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations. Elizabeth dared
not lift up her eyes. How Mr. Darcy looked, therefore, she could not tell.
“It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married,”
continued her mother, “but at the same time, Mr. Bingley, it is very hard to
have her taken such a way from me. They are gone down to Newcastle, a
place quite northward, it seems, and there they are to stay I do not know how
long. His regiment is there; for I suppose you have heard of his leaving the
——shire, and of his being gone into the regulars. Thank Heaven! he has
some friends, though perhaps not so many as he deserves.”
Elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in such misery
of shame, that she could hardly keep her seat. It drew from her, however, the
exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually done before; and
she asked Bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the country at
present. A few weeks, he believed.
“When you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley,” said her mother,
“I beg you will come here, and shoot as many as you please on Mr. Bennet’s
manor. I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and will save all the
best of the covies for you.”
Elizabeth’s misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious attention!
Were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had flattered them a year
ago, every thing, she was persuaded, would be hastening to the same vexatious
conclusion. At that instant, she felt that years of happiness could not make
Jane or herself amends for moments of such painful confusion.
“The first wish of my heart,” said she to herself, “is never more to be in
company with either of them. Their society can afford no pleasure that will
atone for such wretchedness as this! Let me never see either one or the other
again!”
Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no
compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing how
much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the admiration of her former lover.
When first he came in, he had spoken to her but little; but every five minutes
seemed to be giving her more of his attention. He found her as handsome as
she had been last year; as good natured, and as unaffected, though not quite so
chatty. Jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all,
and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever. But her mind was so
busily engaged, that she did not always know when she was silent.
When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs. Bennet was mindful of her
intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at Longbourn in a
few days time.
“You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr. Bingley,” she added, “for when you
went to town last winter, you promised to take a family dinner with us, as soon
as you returned. I have not forgot, you see; and I assure you, I was very much
disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement.”
Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of his
concern at having been prevented by business. They then went away.
Mrs. Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there
that day; but, though she always kept a very good table, she did not think
anything less than two courses could be good enough for a man on whom she
had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten
thousand a year.
Chapter 54
As soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits; or
in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must
deaden them more. Mr. Darcy’s behaviour astonished and vexed her.
“Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent,” said she, “did
he come at all?”
She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.
“He could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and aunt, when he
was in town; and why not to me? If he fears me, why come hither? If he no
longer cares for me, why silent? Teasing, teasing, man! I will think no more
about him.”
Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of
her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look, which showed her better
satisfied with their visitors, than Elizabeth.
“Now,” said she, “that this first meeting is over, I feel perfectly easy. I
know my own strength, and I shall never be embarrassed again by his coming.
I am glad he dines here on Tuesday. It will then be publicly seen that, on both
sides, we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance.”
“Yes, very indifferent indeed,” said Elizabeth, laughingly. “Oh, Jane, take
care.”
“My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak, as to be in danger now?”
“I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with
you as ever.”
They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs. Bennet, in the
meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes, which the good humour
and common politeness of Bingley, in half an hour’s visit, had revived.
On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and the two
who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality as
sportsmen, were in very good time. When they repaired to the dining-room,
Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take the place,
which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by her sister. Her
prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore to invite him to sit by
herself. On entering the room, he seemed to hesitate; but Jane happened to
look round, and happened to smile: it was decided. He placed himself by her.
Elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend. He bore
it with noble indifference, and she would have imagined that Bingley had
received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes likewise turned
towards Mr. Darcy, with an expression of half-laughing alarm.
His behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as showed an
admiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded
Elizabeth, that if left wholly to himself, Jane’s happiness, and his own, would
be speedily secured. Though she dared not depend upon the consequence, she
yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour. It gave her all the
animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in no cheerful humour. Mr.
Darcy was almost as far from her as the table could divide them. He was on
one side of her mother. She knew how little such a situation would give
pleasure to either, or make either appear to advantage. She was not near
enough to hear any of their discourse, but she could see how seldom they
spoke to each other, and how formal and cold was their manner whenever they
did. Her mother’s ungraciousness, made the sense of what they owed him
more painful to Elizabeth’s mind; and she would, at times, have given
anything to be privileged to tell him that his kindness was neither unknown
nor unfelt by the whole of the family.
She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of
bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away
without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation than the
mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance. Anxious and uneasy, the
period which passed in the drawing-room, before the gentlemen came, was
wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her uncivil. She looked
forward to their entrance as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for
the evening must depend.
“If he does not come to me, then,” said she, “I shall give him up for ever.”
The gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have
answered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded round the table, where
Miss Bennet was making tea, and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee, in so close
a confederacy that there was not a single vacancy near her which would admit
of a chair. And on the gentlemen’s approaching, one of the girls moved closer
to her than ever, and said, in a whisper:
“The men shan’t come and part us, I am determined. We want none of
them; do we?”
Darcy had walked away to another part of the room. She followed him
with her eyes, envied everyone to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience
enough to help anybody to coffee; and then was enraged against herself for
being so silly!
“A man who has once been refused! How could I ever be foolish enough to
expect a renewal of his love? Is there one among the sex, who would not
protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman?
There is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings!”
She was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee cup
himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying:
“Is your sister at Pemberley still?”
“Yes, she will remain there till Christmas.”
“And quite alone? Have all her friends left her?”
“Mrs. Annesley is with her. The others have been gone on to Scarborough,
these three weeks.”
She could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse with
her, he might have better success. He stood by her, however, for some minutes,
in silence; and, at last, on the young lady’s whispering to Elizabeth again, he
walked away.
When the tea-things were removed, and the card-tables placed, the ladies
all rose, and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him, when all her
views were overthrown by seeing him fall a victim to her mother’s rapacity for
whist players, and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party. She
now lost every expectation of pleasure. They were confined for the evening at
different tables, and she had nothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often
turned towards her side of the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as
herself.
Mrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to
supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others, and
she had no opportunity of detaining them.
“Well girls,” said she, as soon as they were left to themselves, “What say
you to the day? I think every thing has passed off uncommonly well, I assure
you. The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw. The venison was
roasted to a turn—and everybody said they never saw so fat a haunch. The
soup was fifty times better than what we had at the Lucases’ last week; and
even Mr. Darcy acknowledged, that the partridges were remarkably well done;
and I suppose he has two or three French cooks at least. And, my dear Jane, I
never saw you look in greater beauty. Mrs. Long said so too, for I asked her
whether you did not. And what do you think she said besides? ‘Ah! Mrs.
Bennet, we shall have her at Netherfield at last.’ She did indeed. I do think
Mrs. Long is as good a creature as ever lived—and her nieces are very pretty
behaved girls, and not at all handsome: I like them prodigiously.”
Mrs. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen enough of
Bingley’s behaviour to Jane, to be convinced that she would get him at last;
and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy humour,
were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him
there again the next day, to make his proposals.
“It has been a very agreeable day,” said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth. “The
party seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other. I hope we may
often meet again.”
Elizabeth smiled.
“Lizzy, you must not do so. You must not suspect me. It mortifies me. I
assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and
sensible young man, without having a wish beyond it. I am perfectly satisfied,
from what his manners now are, that he never had any design of engaging my
affection. It is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address, and a
stronger desire of generally pleasing, than any other man.”
“You are very cruel,” said her sister, “you will not let me smile, and are
provoking me to it every moment.”
“How hard it is in some cases to be believed!”
“And how impossible in others!”
“But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I
acknowledge?”
“That is a question which I hardly know how to answer. We all love to
instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing. Forgive me;
and if you persist in indifference, do not make me your confidante.”
Chapter 55
A few days after this visit, Mr. Bingley called again, and alone. His friend
had left him that morning for London, but was to return home in ten days time.
He sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably good spirits. Mrs.
Bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many expressions of concern,
he confessed himself engaged elsewhere.
“Next time you call,” said she, “I hope we shall be more lucky.”
He should be particularly happy at any time, etc. etc.; and if she would
give him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on them.
“Can you come to-morrow?”
Yes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her invitation was
accepted with alacrity.
He came, and in such very good time that the ladies were none of them
dressed. In ran Mrs. Bennet to her daughter’s room, in her dressing gown, and
with her hair half finished, crying out:
“My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down. He is come—Mr. Bingley is
come. He is, indeed. Make haste, make haste. Here, Sarah, come to Miss
Bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown. Never mind Miss Lizzy’s
hair.”
“We will be down as soon as we can,” said Jane; “but I dare say Kitty is
forwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs half an hour ago.”
“Oh! hang Kitty! what has she to do with it? Come be quick, be quick!
Where is your sash, my dear?”
But when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to go down
without one of her sisters.
The same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the
evening. After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the library, as was his custom, and
Mary went up stairs to her instrument. Two obstacles of the five being thus
removed, Mrs. Bennet sat looking and winking at Elizabeth and Catherine for
a considerable time, without making any impression on them. Elizabeth would
not observe her; and when at last Kitty did, she very innocently said, “What is
the matter mamma? What do you keep winking at me for? What am I to do?”
“Nothing child, nothing. I did not wink at you.” She then sat still five
minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she suddenly
got up, and saying to Kitty, “Come here, my love, I want to speak to you,”
took her out of the room. Jane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth which spoke
her distress at such premeditation, and her entreaty that she would not give in
to it. In a few minutes, Mrs. Bennet half-opened the door and called out:
“Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you.”
Elizabeth was forced to go.
“We may as well leave them by themselves you know;” said her mother, as
soon as she was in the hall. “Kitty and I are going up stairs to sit in my
dressing-room.”
Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained quietly
in the hall, till she and Kitty were out of sight, then returned into the drawingroom.
Mrs. Bennet’s schemes for this day were ineffectual. Bingley was every
thing that was charming, except the professed lover of her daughter. His ease
and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening
party; and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the mother, and heard
all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance
particularly grateful to the daughter.
He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went away,
an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and Mrs. Bennet’s means,
for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband.
After this day, Jane said no more of her indifference. Not a word passed
between the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went to bed in the happy
belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr. Darcy returned within
the stated time. Seriously, however, she felt tolerably persuaded that all this
must have taken place with that gentleman’s concurrence.
Bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr. Bennet spent the
morning together, as had been agreed on. The latter was much more agreeable
than his companion expected. There was nothing of presumption or folly in
Bingley that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him into silence; and he
was more communicative, and less eccentric, than the other had ever seen him.
Bingley of course returned with him to dinner; and in the evening Mrs.
Bennet’s invention was again at work to get every body away from him and
her daughter. Elizabeth, who had a letter to write, went into the breakfast room
for that purpose soon after tea; for as the others were all going to sit down to
cards, she could not be wanted to counteract her mother’s schemes.
But on returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was finished, she
saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her mother had been
too ingenious for her. On opening the door, she perceived her sister and
Bingley standing together over the hearth, as if engaged in earnest
conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the faces of both, as they hastily
turned round and moved away from each other, would have told it all. Their
situation was awkward enough; but hers she thought was still worse. Not a
syllable was uttered by either; and Elizabeth was on the point of going away
again, when Bingley, who as well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose,
and whispering a few words to her sister, ran out of the room.
Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence would give
pleasure; and instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest
emotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world.
“‘Tis too much!” she added, “by far too much. I do not deserve it. Oh! why
is not everybody as happy?”
Elizabeth’s congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth, a
delight, which words could but poorly express. Every sentence of kindness
was a fresh source of happiness to Jane. But she would not allow herself to
stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be said for the present.
“I must go instantly to my mother;” she cried. “I would not on any account
trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow her to hear it from anyone but
myself. He is gone to my father already. Oh! Lizzy, to know that what I have
to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family! how shall I bear so
much happiness!”
She then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the
card party, and was sitting up stairs with Kitty.
Elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease
with which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many previous
months of suspense and vexation.
“And this,” said she, “is the end of all his friend’s anxious circumspection!
of all his sister’s falsehood and contrivance! the happiest, wisest, most
reasonable end!”
In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference with her
father had been short and to the purpose.
“Where is your sister?” said he hastily, as he opened the door.
“With my mother up stairs. She will be down in a moment, I dare say.”
He then shut the door, and, coming up to her, claimed the good wishes and
affection of a sister. Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in
the prospect of their relationship. They shook hands with great cordiality; and
then, till her sister came down, she had to listen to all he had to say of his own
happiness, and of Jane’s perfections; and in spite of his being a lover,
Elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity to be rationally
founded, because they had for basis the excellent understanding, and superexcellent disposition of Jane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste
between her and himself.
It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of
Miss Bennet’s mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face, as made
her look handsomer than ever. Kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped her turn
was coming soon. Mrs. Bennet could not give her consent or speak her
approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings, though she talked to
Bingley of nothing else for half an hour; and when Mr. Bennet joined them at
supper, his voice and manner plainly showed how really happy he was.
Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their visitor took
his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he turned to his daughter,
and said:
“Jane, I congratulate you. You will be a very happy woman.”
Jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his goodness.
“You are a good girl;” he replied, “and I have great pleasure in thinking
you will be so happily settled. I have not a doubt of your doing very well
together. Your tempers are by no means unlike. You are each of you so
complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so easy, that every servant
will cheat you; and so generous, that you will always exceed your income.”
“I hope not so. Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be
unpardonable in me.”
“Exceed their income! My dear Mr. Bennet,” cried his wife, “what are you
talking of? Why, he has four or five thousand a year, and very likely more.”
Then addressing her daughter, “Oh! my dear, dear Jane, I am so happy! I am
sure I shan’t get a wink of sleep all night. I knew how it would be. I always
said it must be so, at last. I was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing!
I remember, as soon as ever I saw him, when he first came into Hertfordshire
last year, I thought how likely it was that you should come together. Oh! he is
the handsomest young man that ever was seen!”
Wickham, Lydia, were all forgotten. Jane was beyond competition her
favourite child. At that moment, she cared for no other. Her younger sisters
soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might
in future be able to dispense.
Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and Kitty begged
very hard for a few balls there every winter.
Bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn;
coming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after supper;
unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough detested,
had given him an invitation to dinner which he thought himself obliged to
accept.
Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for while
he was present, Jane had no attention to bestow on anyone else; but she found
herself considerably useful to both of them in those hours of separation that
must sometimes occur. In the absence of Jane, he always attached himself to
Elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking of her; and when Bingley was gone, Jane
constantly sought the same means of relief.
“He has made me so happy,” said she, one evening, “by telling me that he
was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! I had not believed it
possible.”
“I suspected as much,” replied Elizabeth. “But how did he account for it?”
“It must have been his sister’s doing. They were certainly no friends to his
acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at, since he might have chosen
so much more advantageously in many respects. But when they see, as I trust
they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will learn to be contented,
and we shall be on good terms again; though we can never be what we once
were to each other.”
“That is the most unforgiving speech,” said Elizabeth, “that I ever heard
you utter. Good girl! It would vex me, indeed, to see you again the dupe of
Miss Bingley’s pretended regard.”
“Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last November, he
really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of my being indifferent would
have prevented his coming down again!”
“He made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit of his modesty.”
This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence, and the
little value he put on his own good qualities. Elizabeth was pleased to find that
he had not betrayed the interference of his friend; for, though Jane had the
most generous and forgiving heart in the world, she knew it was a
circumstance which must prejudice her against him.
“I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!” cried Jane.
“Oh! Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family, and blessed above them
all! If I could but see you as happy! If there were but such another man for
you!”
“If you were to give me forty such men, I never could be so happy as you.
Till I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can have your happiness.
No, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if I have very good luck, I may
meet with another Mr. Collins in time.”
The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a secret.
Mrs. Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs. Phillips, and she ventured,
without any permission, to do the same by all her neighbours in Meryton.
The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the
world, though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first run away, they
had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune.
Chapter 56
One morning, about a week after Bingley’s engagement with Jane had
been formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the
dining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window, by the sound
of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn. It was
too early in the morning for visitors, and besides, the equipage did not answer
to that of any of their neighbours. The horses were post; and neither the
carriage, nor the livery of the servant who preceded it, were familiar to them.
As it was certain, however, that somebody was coming, Bingley instantly
prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion, and
walk away with him into the shrubbery. They both set off, and the conjectures
of the remaining three continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door
was thrown open and their visitor entered. It was Lady Catherine de Bourgh.
They were of course all intending to be surprised; but their astonishment
was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mrs. Bennet and Kitty,
though she was perfectly unknown to them, even inferior to what Elizabeth
felt.
She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no
other reply to Elizabeth’s salutation than a slight inclination of the head, and
sat down without saying a word. Elizabeth had mentioned her name to her
mother on her ladyship’s entrance, though no request of introduction had been
made.
Mrs. Bennet, all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such
high importance, received her with the utmost politeness. After sitting for a
moment in silence, she said very stiffly to Elizabeth,
“I hope you are well, Miss Bennet. That lady, I suppose, is your mother.”
Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was.
“And that I suppose is one of your sisters.”
“Yes, madam,” said Mrs. Bennet, delighted to speak to Lady Catherine.
“She is my youngest girl but one. My youngest of all is lately married, and my
eldest is somewhere about the grounds, walking with a young man who, I
believe, will soon become a part of the family.”
“You have a very small park here,” returned Lady Catherine after a short
silence.
“It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my lady, I dare say; but I assure
you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas’s.”
“This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening, in
summer; the windows are full west.”
Mrs. Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner, and then
added:
“May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left Mr. and
Mrs. Collins well.”
“Yes, very well. I saw them the night before last.”
Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from
Charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling. But no letter
appeared, and she was completely puzzled.
Mrs. Bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take some
refreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not very politely,
declined eating anything; and then, rising up, said to Elizabeth,
“Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on
one side of your lawn. I should be glad to take a turn in it, if you will favour
me with your company.”
“Go, my dear,” cried her mother, “and show her ladyship about the
different walks. I think she will be pleased with the hermitage.”
Elizabeth obeyed, and running into her own room for her parasol, attended
her noble guest downstairs. As they passed through the hall, Lady Catherine
opened the doors into the dining-parlour and drawing-room, and pronouncing
them, after a short survey, to be decent looking rooms, walked on.
Her carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her waitingwoman was in it. They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to
the copse; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a
woman who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable.
“How could I ever think her like her nephew?” said she, as she looked in
her face.
As soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the following
manner:—
“You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of my
journey hither. Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why I
come.”
Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.
“Indeed, you are mistaken, Madam. I have not been at all able to account
for the honour of seeing you here.”
“Miss Bennet,” replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, “you ought to know,
that I am not to be trifled with. But however insincere you may choose to be,
you shall not find me so. My character has ever been celebrated for its
sincerity and frankness, and in a cause of such moment as this, I shall certainly
not depart from it. A report of a most alarming nature reached me two days
ago. I was told that not only your sister was on the point of being most
advantageously married, but that you, that Miss Elizabeth Bennet, would, in
all likelihood, be soon afterwards united to my nephew, my own nephew, Mr.
Darcy. Though I know it must be a scandalous falsehood, though I would not
injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved
on setting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known to you.”
“If you believed it impossible to be true,” said Elizabeth, colouring with
astonishment and disdain, “I wonder you took the trouble of coming so far.
What could your ladyship propose by it?”
“At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted.”
“Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family,” said Elizabeth
coolly, “will be rather a confirmation of it; if, indeed, such a report is in
existence.”
“If! Do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? Has it not been industriously
circulated by yourselves? Do you not know that such a report is spread
abroad?”
“I never heard that it was.”
“And can you likewise declare, that there is no foundation for it?”
“I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship. You may
ask questions which I shall not choose to answer.”
“This is not to be borne. Miss Bennet, I insist on being satisfied. Has he,
has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?”
“Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible.”
“It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his reason. But
your arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation, have made him
forget what he owes to himself and to all his family. You may have drawn him
in.”
“If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it.”
“Miss Bennet, do you know who I am? I have not been accustomed to such
language as this. I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world, and am
entitled to know all his dearest concerns.”
“But you are not entitled to know mine; nor will such behaviour as this,
ever induce me to be explicit.”
“Let me be rightly understood. This match, to which you have the
presumption to aspire, can never take place. No, never. Mr. Darcy is engaged
to my daughter. Now what have you to say?”
“Only this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will make
an offer to me.”
Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied:
“The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind. From their infancy,
they have been intended for each other. It was the favourite wish of his
mother, as well as of hers. While in their cradles, we planned the union: and
now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished in
their marriage, to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth, of no
importance in the world, and wholly unallied to the family! Do you pay no
regard to the wishes of his friends? To his tacit engagement with Miss de
Bourgh? Are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy? Have you not
heard me say that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin?”
“Yes, and I had heard it before. But what is that to me? If there is no other
objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly not be kept from it by
knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry Miss de Bourgh. You
both did as much as you could in planning the marriage. Its completion
depended on others. If Mr. Darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined
to his cousin, why is not he to make another choice? And if I am that choice,
why may not I accept him?”
“Because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it. Yes, Miss
Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends, if you
wilfully act against the inclinations of all. You will be censured, slighted, and
despised, by everyone connected with him. Your alliance will be a disgrace;
your name will never even be mentioned by any of us.”
“These are heavy misfortunes,” replied Elizabeth. “But the wife of Mr.
Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached
to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause to repine.”
“Obstinate, headstrong girl! I am ashamed of you! Is this your gratitude for
my attentions to you last spring? Is nothing due to me on that score? Let us sit
down. You are to understand, Miss Bennet, that I came here with the
determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will I be dissuaded from it.
I have not been used to submit to any person’s whims. I have not been in the
habit of brooking disappointment.”
“That will make your ladyship’s situation at present more pitiable; but it
will have no effect on me.”
“I will not be interrupted. Hear me in silence. My daughter and my nephew
are formed for each other. They are descended, on the maternal side, from the
same noble line; and, on the father’s, from respectable, honourable, and
ancient—though untitled—families. Their fortune on both sides is splendid.
They are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their
respective houses; and what is to divide them? The upstart pretensions of a
young woman without family, connections, or fortune. Is this to be endured!
But it must not, shall not be. If you were sensible of your own good, you
would not wish to quit the sphere in which you have been brought up.”
“In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as quitting that
sphere. He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman’s daughter; so far we are equal.”
“True. You are a gentleman’s daughter. But who was your mother? Who
are your uncles and aunts? Do not imagine me ignorant of their condition.”
“Whatever my connections may be,” said Elizabeth, “if your nephew does
not object to them, they can be nothing to you.”
“Tell me once for all, are you engaged to him?”
Though Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Lady
Catherine, have answered this question, she could not but say, after a
moment’s deliberation:
“I am not.”
Lady Catherine seemed pleased.
“And will you promise me, never to enter into such an engagement?”
“I will make no promise of the kind.”
“Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished. I expected to find a more
reasonable young woman. But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I will
ever recede. I shall not go away till you have given me the assurance I
require.”
“And I certainly never shall give it. I am not to be intimidated into
anything so wholly unreasonable. Your ladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marry
your daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise make their
marriage at all more probable? Supposing him to be attached to me, would my
refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin? Allow
me to say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with which you have supported
this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application was illjudged. You have widely mistaken my character, if you think I can be worked
on by such persuasions as these. How far your nephew might approve of your
interference in his affairs, I cannot tell; but you have certainly no right to
concern yourself in mine. I must beg, therefore, to be importuned no farther on
the subject.”
“Not so hasty, if you please. I have by no means done. To all the objections
I have already urged, I have still another to add. I am no stranger to the
particulars of your youngest sister’s infamous elopement. I know it all; that the
young man’s marrying her was a patched-up business, at the expence of your
father and uncles. And is such a girl to be my nephew’s sister? Is her husband,
is the son of his late father’s steward, to be his brother? Heaven and earth!—of
what are you thinking? Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?”
“You can now have nothing further to say,” she resentfully answered. “You
have insulted me in every possible method. I must beg to return to the house.”
And she rose as she spoke. Lady Catherine rose also, and they turned back.
Her ladyship was highly incensed.
“You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew!
Unfeeling, selfish girl! Do you not consider that a connection with you must
disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?”
“Lady Catherine, I have nothing further to say. You know my sentiments.”
“You are then resolved to have him?”
“I have said no such thing. I am only resolved to act in that manner, which
will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without reference to you, or
to any person so wholly unconnected with me.”
“It is well. You refuse, then, to oblige me. You refuse to obey the claims of
duty, honour, and gratitude. You are determined to ruin him in the opinion of
all his friends, and make him the contempt of the world.”
“Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude,” replied Elizabeth, “have any
possible claim on me, in the present instance. No principle of either would be
violated by my marriage with Mr. Darcy. And with regard to the resentment of
his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former were excited by his
marrying me, it would not give me one moment’s concern—and the world in
general would have too much sense to join in the scorn.”
“And this is your real opinion! This is your final resolve! Very well. I shall
now know how to act. Do not imagine, Miss Bennet, that your ambition will
ever be gratified. I came to try you. I hoped to find you reasonable; but,
depend upon it, I will carry my point.”
In this manner Lady Catherine talked on, till they were at the door of the
carriage, when, turning hastily round, she added, “I take no leave of you, Miss
Bennet. I send no compliments to your mother. You deserve no such attention.
I am most seriously displeased.”
Elizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her
ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself. She heard the
carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs. Her mother impatiently met
her at the door of the dressing-room, to ask why Lady Catherine would not
come in again and rest herself.
“She did not choose it,” said her daughter, “she would go.”
“She is a very fine-looking woman! and her calling here was prodigiously
civil! for she only came, I suppose, to tell us the Collinses were well. She is on
her road somewhere, I dare say, and so, passing through Meryton, thought she
might as well call on you. I suppose she had nothing particular to say to you,
Lizzy?”
Elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here; for to
acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.
Chapter 57
The discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw Elizabeth
into, could not be easily overcome; nor could she, for many hours, learn to
think of it less than incessantly. Lady Catherine, it appeared, had actually
taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings, for the sole purpose of
breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr. Darcy. It was a rational
scheme, to be sure! but from what the report of their engagement could
originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine; till she recollected that his being
the intimate friend of Bingley, and her being the sister of Jane, was enough, at
a time when the expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for
another, to supply the idea. She had not herself forgotten to feel that the
marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together. And her
neighbours at Lucas Lodge, therefore (for through their communication with
the Collinses, the report, she concluded, had reached Lady Catherine), had
only set that down as almost certain and immediate, which she had looked
forward to as possible at some future time.
In revolving Lady Catherine’s expressions, however, she could not help
feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this
interference. From what she had said of her resolution to prevent their
marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her
nephew; and how he might take a similar representation of the evils attached
to a connection with her, she dared not pronounce. She knew not the exact
degree of his affection for his aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it
was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she
could do; and it was certain that, in enumerating the miseries of a marriage
with one, whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt
would address him on his weakest side. With his notions of dignity, he would
probably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak and
ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.
If he had been wavering before as to what he should do, which had often
seemed likely, the advice and entreaty of so near a relation might settle every
doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity unblemished could
make him. In that case he would return no more. Lady Catherine might see
him in her way through town; and his engagement to Bingley of coming again
to Netherfield must give way.
“If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his
friend within a few days,” she added, “I shall know how to understand it. I
shall then give over every expectation, every wish of his constancy. If he is
satisfied with only regretting me, when he might have obtained my affections
and hand, I shall soon cease to regret him at all.”
The surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had
been, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied it, with the same kind of
supposition which had appeased Mrs. Bennet’s curiosity; and Elizabeth was
spared from much teasing on the subject.
The next morning, as she was going downstairs, she was met by her father,
who came out of his library with a letter in his hand.
“Lizzy,” said he, “I was going to look for you; come into my room.”
She followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her
was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with
the letter he held. It suddenly struck her that it might be from Lady Catherine;
and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations.
She followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat down. He then
said,
“I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly.
As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its contents. I did not
know before, that I had two daughters on the brink of matrimony. Let me
congratulate you on a very important conquest.”
The colour now rushed into Elizabeth’s cheeks in the instantaneous
conviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt; and she
was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all,
or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself; when her father
continued:
“You look conscious. Young ladies have great penetration in such matters
as these; but I think I may defy even your sagacity, to discover the name of
your admirer. This letter is from Mr. Collins.”
“From Mr. Collins! and what can he have to say?”
“Something very much to the purpose of course. He begins with
congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of which, it
seems, he has been told by some of the good-natured, gossiping Lucases. I
shall not sport with your impatience, by reading what he says on that point.
What relates to yourself, is as follows: ‘Having thus offered you the sincere
congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself on this happy event, let me now
add a short hint on the subject of another; of which we have been advertised
by the same authority. Your daughter Elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long
bear the name of Bennet, after her elder sister has resigned it, and the chosen
partner of her fate may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most
illustrious personages in this land.’
“Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this? ‘This young
gentleman is blessed, in a peculiar way, with every thing the heart of mortal
can most desire,—splendid property, noble kindred, and extensive patronage.
Yet in spite of all these temptations, let me warn my cousin Elizabeth, and
yourself, of what evils you may incur by a precipitate closure with this
gentleman’s proposals, which, of course, you will be inclined to take
immediate advantage of.’
“Have you any idea, Lizzy, who this gentleman is? But now it comes out:
“‘My motive for cautioning you is as follows. We have reason to imagine
that his aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on the match with a
friendly eye.’
“Mr. Darcy, you see, is the man! Now, Lizzy, I think I have surprised you.
Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man within the circle of our
acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what
they related? Mr. Darcy, who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish,
and who probably never looked at you in his life! It is admirable!”
Elizabeth tried to join in her father’s pleasantry, but could only force one
most reluctant smile. Never had his wit been directed in a manner so little
agreeable to her.
“Are you not diverted?”
“Oh! yes. Pray read on.”
“‘After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last
night, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she felt
on the occasion; when it became apparent, that on the score of some family
objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give her consent to what
she termed so disgraceful a match. I thought it my duty to give the speediest
intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and her noble admirer may be aware
of what they are about, and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been
properly sanctioned.’ Mr. Collins moreover adds, ‘I am truly rejoiced that my
cousin Lydia’s sad business has been so well hushed up, and am only
concerned that their living together before the marriage took place should be
so generally known. I must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or
refrain from declaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young
couple into your house as soon as they were married. It was an encouragement
of vice; and had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should very strenuously
have opposed it. You ought certainly to forgive them, as a Christian, but never
to admit them in your sight, or allow their names to be mentioned in your
hearing.’ That is his notion of Christian forgiveness! The rest of his letter is
only about his dear Charlotte’s situation, and his expectation of a young olivebranch. But, Lizzy, you look as if you did not enjoy it. You are not going to be
missish, I hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report. For what do we
live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our turn?”
“Oh!” cried Elizabeth, “I am excessively diverted. But it is so strange!”
“Yes—that is what makes it amusing. Had they fixed on any other man it
would have been nothing; but his perfect indifference, and your pointed
dislike, make it so delightfully absurd! Much as I abominate writing, I would
not give up Mr. Collins’s correspondence for any consideration. Nay, when I
read a letter of his, I cannot help giving him the preference even over
Wickham, much as I value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son-in-law.
And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine about this report? Did she call to
refuse her consent?”
To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had been
asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by his repeating it.
Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they
were not. It was necessary to laugh, when she would rather have cried. Her
father had most cruelly mortified her, by what he said of Mr. Darcy’s
indifference, and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of
penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead of his seeing too little, she might have
fancied too much.
Chapter 58
Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as Elizabeth
half expected Mr. Bingley to do, he was able to bring Darcy with him to
Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine’s visit. The
gentlemen arrived early; and, before Mrs. Bennet had time to tell him of their
having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat in momentary dread, Bingley,
who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed their all walking out. It was
agreed to. Mrs. Bennet was not in the habit of walking; Mary could never
spare time; but the remaining five set off together. Bingley and Jane, however,
soon allowed the others to outstrip them. They lagged behind, while Elizabeth,
Kitty, and Darcy were to entertain each other. Very little was said by either;
Kitty was too much afraid of him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a
desperate resolution; and perhaps he might be doing the same.
They walked towards the Lucases, because Kitty wished to call upon
Maria; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern,
when Kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone. Now was the
moment for her resolution to be executed, and, while her courage was high,
she immediately said:
“Mr. Darcy, I am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of giving relief
to my own feelings, care not how much I may be wounding yours. I can no
longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister.
Ever since I have known it, I have been most anxious to acknowledge to you
how gratefully I feel it. Were it known to the rest of my family, I should not
have merely my own gratitude to express.”
“I am sorry, exceedingly sorry,” replied Darcy, in a tone of surprise and
emotion, “that you have ever been informed of what may, in a mistaken light,
have given you uneasiness. I did not think Mrs. Gardiner was so little to be
trusted.”
“You must not blame my aunt. Lydia’s thoughtlessness first betrayed to me
that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, I could not rest till I
knew the particulars. Let me thank you again and again, in the name of all my
family, for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much
trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the sake of discovering them.”
“If you will thank me,” he replied, “let it be for yourself alone. That the
wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other inducements
which led me on, I shall not attempt to deny. But your family owe me nothing.
Much as I respect them, I believe I thought only of you.”
Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word. After a short pause,
her companion added, “You are too generous to trifle with me. If your feelings
are still what they were last April, tell me so at once. My affections and wishes
are unchanged, but one word from you will silence me on this subject for
ever.”
Elizabeth, feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of
his situation, now forced herself to speak; and immediately, though not very
fluently, gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone so material
a change, since the period to which he alluded, as to make her receive with
gratitude and pleasure his present assurances. The happiness which this reply
produced, was such as he had probably never felt before; and he expressed
himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love
can be supposed to do. Had Elizabeth been able to encounter his eye, she
might have seen how well the expression of heartfelt delight, diffused over his
face, became him; but, though she could not look, she could listen, and he told
her of feelings, which, in proving of what importance she was to him, made
his affection every moment more valuable.
They walked on, without knowing in what direction. There was too much
to be thought, and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects. She soon
learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the
efforts of his aunt, who did call on him in her return through London, and
there relate her journey to Longbourn, its motive, and the substance of her
conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on every expression of the
latter which, in her ladyship’s apprehension, peculiarly denoted her
perverseness and assurance; in the belief that such a relation must assist her
endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew which she had refused to
give. But, unluckily for her ladyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise.
“It taught me to hope,” said he, “as I had scarcely ever allowed myself to
hope before. I knew enough of your disposition to be certain that, had you
been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would have
acknowledged it to Lady Catherine, frankly and openly.”
Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, “Yes, you know enough of
my frankness to believe me capable of that. After abusing you so abominably
to your face, I could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations.”
“What did you say of me, that I did not deserve? For, though your
accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my behaviour to
you at the time had merited the severest reproof. It was unpardonable. I cannot
think of it without abhorrence.”
“We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that
evening,” said Elizabeth. “The conduct of neither, if strictly examined, will be
irreproachable; but since then, we have both, I hope, improved in civility.”
“I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself. The recollection of what I then
said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of it, is
now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me. Your reproof, so
well applied, I shall never forget: ‘had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike
manner.’ Those were your words. You know not, you can scarcely conceive,
how they have tortured me;—though it was some time, I confess, before I was
reasonable enough to allow their justice.”
“I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an
impression. I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way.”
“I can easily believe it. You thought me then devoid of every proper
feeling, I am sure you did. The turn of your countenance I shall never forget,
as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible way that would
induce you to accept me.”
“Oh! do not repeat what I then said. These recollections will not do at all. I
assure you that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it.”
Darcy mentioned his letter. “Did it,” said he, “did it soon make you think
better of me? Did you, on reading it, give any credit to its contents?”
She explained what its effect on her had been, and how gradually all her
former prejudices had been removed.
“I knew,” said he, “that what I wrote must give you pain, but it was
necessary. I hope you have destroyed the letter. There was one part especially,
the opening of it, which I should dread your having the power of reading
again. I can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate
me.”
“The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the
preservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my
opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so easily changed
as that implies.”
“When I wrote that letter,” replied Darcy, “I believed myself perfectly calm
and cool, but I am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness
of spirit.”
“The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so. The adieu is
charity itself. But think no more of the letter. The feelings of the person who
wrote, and the person who received it, are now so widely different from what
they were then, that every unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be
forgotten. You must learn some of my philosophy. Think only of the past as its
remembrance gives you pleasure.”
“I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind. Your
retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment arising
from them is not of philosophy, but, what is much better, of innocence. But
with me, it is not so. Painful recollections will intrude which cannot, which
ought not, to be repelled. I have been a selfish being all my life, in practice,
though not in principle. As a child I was taught what was right, but I was not
taught to correct my temper. I was given good principles, but left to follow
them in pride and conceit. Unfortunately an only son (for many years an only
child), I was spoilt by my parents, who, though good themselves (my father,
particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable), allowed, encouraged,
almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing; to care for none beyond my
own family circle; to think meanly of all the rest of the world; to wish at least
to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own. Such I was,
from eight to eight and twenty; and such I might still have been but for you,
dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not owe you! You taught me a lesson,
hard indeed at first, but most advantageous. By you, I was properly humbled. I
came to you without a doubt of my reception. You showed me how
insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being
pleased.”
“Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?”
“Indeed I had. What will you think of my vanity? I believed you to be
wishing, expecting my addresses.”
“My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally, I assure you. I
never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me wrong. How
you must have hated me after that evening?”
“Hate you! I was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began to take a
proper direction.”
“I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me, when we met at
Pemberley. You blamed me for coming?”
“No indeed; I felt nothing but surprise.”
“Your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed by you. My
conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness, and I confess
that I did not expect to receive more than my due.”
“My object then,” replied Darcy, “was to show you, by every civility in my
power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped to obtain your
forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you see that your reproofs
had been attended to. How soon any other wishes introduced themselves I can
hardly tell, but I believe in about half an hour after I had seen you.”
He then told her of Georgiana’s delight in her acquaintance, and of her
disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to the cause
of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from
Derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed before he quitted the inn,
and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there had arisen from no other
struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend.
She expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to each,
to be dwelt on farther.
After walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know
anything about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that it was
time to be at home.
“What could become of Mr. Bingley and Jane!” was a wonder which
introduced the discussion of their affairs. Darcy was delighted with their
engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of it.
“I must ask whether you were surprised?” said Elizabeth.
“Not at all. When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen.”
“That is to say, you had given your permission. I guessed as much.” And
though he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had been pretty much the
case.
“On the evening before my going to London,” said he, “I made a
confession to him, which I believe I ought to have made long ago. I told him
of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs absurd
and impertinent. His surprise was great. He had never had the slightest
suspicion. I told him, moreover, that I believed myself mistaken in supposing,
as I had done, that your sister was indifferent to him; and as I could easily
perceive that his attachment to her was unabated, I felt no doubt of their
happiness together.”
Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend.
“Did you speak from your own observation,” said she, “when you told him
that my sister loved him, or merely from my information last spring?”
“From the former. I had narrowly observed her during the two visits which
I had lately made here; and I was convinced of her affection.”
“And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate conviction to
him.”
“It did. Bingley is most unaffectedly modest. His diffidence had prevented
his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, but his reliance on
mine made every thing easy. I was obliged to confess one thing, which for a
time, and not unjustly, offended him. I could not allow myself to conceal that
your sister had been in town three months last winter, that I had known it, and
purposely kept it from him. He was angry. But his anger, I am persuaded,
lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister’s sentiments. He
has heartily forgiven me now.”
Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr. Bingley had been a most delightful
friend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable; but she checked herself.
She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed at, and it was rather too
early to begin. In anticipating the happiness of Bingley, which of course was
to be inferior only to his own, he continued the conversation till they reached
the house. In the hall they parted.
Chapter 59
“My dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?” was a question
which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered their room, and
from all the others when they sat down to table. She had only to say in reply,
that they had wandered about, till she was beyond her own knowledge. She
coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor anything else, awakened a
suspicion of the truth.
The evening passed quietly, unmarked by anything extraordinary. The
acknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the unacknowledged were silent.
Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth; and
Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather knew that she was happy than felt
herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment, there were other
evils before her. She anticipated what would be felt in the family when her
situation became known; she was aware that no one liked him but Jane; and
even feared that with the others it was a dislike which not all his fortune and
consequence might do away.
At night she opened her heart to Jane. Though suspicion was very far from
Miss Bennet’s general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here.
“You are joking, Lizzy. This cannot be!—engaged to Mr. Darcy! No, no,
you shall not deceive me. I know it to be impossible.”
“This is a wretched beginning indeed! My sole dependence was on you;
and I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not. Yet, indeed, I am in
earnest. I speak nothing but the truth. He still loves me, and we are engaged.”
Jane looked at her doubtingly. “Oh, Lizzy! it cannot be. I know how much
you dislike him.”
“You know nothing of the matter. That is all to be forgot. Perhaps I did not
always love him so well as I do now. But in such cases as these, a good
memory is unpardonable. This is the last time I shall ever remember it
myself.”
Miss Bennet still looked all amazement. Elizabeth again, and more
seriously assured her of its truth.
“Good Heaven! can it be really so! Yet now I must believe you,” cried
Jane. “My dear, dear Lizzy, I would—I do congratulate you—but are you
certain? forgive the question—are you quite certain that you can be happy
with him?”
“There can be no doubt of that. It is settled between us already, that we are
to be the happiest couple in the world. But are you pleased, Jane? Shall you
like to have such a brother?”
“Very, very much. Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more
delight. But we considered it, we talked of it as impossible. And do you really
love him quite well enough? Oh, Lizzy! do anything rather than marry without
affection. Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do?”
“Oh, yes! You will only think I feel more than I ought to do, when I tell
you all.”
“What do you mean?”
“Why, I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley. I am afraid
you will be angry.”
“My dearest sister, now be serious. I want to talk very seriously. Let me
know every thing that I am to know, without delay. Will you tell me how long
you have loved him?”
“It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began. But
I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at
Pemberley.”
Another entreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the desired
effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of attachment.
When convinced on that article, Miss Bennet had nothing further to wish.
“Now I am quite happy,” said she, “for you will be as happy as myself. I
always had a value for him. Were it for nothing but his love of you, I must
always have esteemed him; but now, as Bingley’s friend and your husband,
there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me. But Lizzy, you have
been very sly, very reserved with me. How little did you tell me of what
passed at Pemberley and Lambton! I owe all that I know of it to another, not to
you.”
Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy. She had been unwilling to
mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her
equally avoid the name of his friend. But now she would no longer conceal
from her his share in Lydia’s marriage. All was acknowledged, and half the
night spent in conversation.
“Good gracious!” cried Mrs. Bennet, as she stood at a window the next
morning, “if that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming here again with our
dear Bingley! What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming
here? I had no notion but he would go a-shooting, or something or other, and
not disturb us with his company. What shall we do with him? Lizzy, you must
walk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley’s way.”
Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet was
really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet.
As soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively, and shook
hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good information; and he soon
afterwards said aloud, “Mrs. Bennet, have you no more lanes hereabouts in
which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day?”
“I advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty,” said Mrs. Bennet, “to walk to
Oakham Mount this morning. It is a nice long walk, and Mr. Darcy has never
seen the view.”
“It may do very well for the others,” replied Mr. Bingley; “but I am sure it
will be too much for Kitty. Won’t it, Kitty?” Kitty owned that she had rather
stay at home. Darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the
Mount, and Elizabeth silently consented. As she went up stairs to get ready,
Mrs. Bennet followed her, saying:
“I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that
disagreeable man all to yourself. But I hope you will not mind it: it is all for
Jane’s sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking to him, except just
now and then. So, do not put yourself to inconvenience.”
During their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet’s consent should be
asked in the course of the evening. Elizabeth reserved to herself the
application for her mother’s. She could not determine how her mother would
take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be
enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man. But whether she were
violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it was certain
that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense; and she
could no more bear that Mr. Darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy,
than the first vehemence of her disapprobation.
In the evening, soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library, she saw Mr.
Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was extreme.
She did not fear her father’s opposition, but he was going to be made unhappy;
and that it should be through her means—that she, his favourite child, should
be distressing him by her choice, should be filling him with fears and regrets
in disposing of her—was a wretched reflection, and she sat in misery till Mr.
Darcy appeared again, when, looking at him, she was a little relieved by his
smile. In a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with
Kitty; and, while pretending to admire her work said in a whisper, “Go to your
father, he wants you in the library.” She was gone directly.
Her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious.
“Lizzy,” said he, “what are you doing? Are you out of your senses, to be
accepting this man? Have not you always hated him?”
How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more
reasonable, her expressions more moderate! It would have spared her from
explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give; but
they were now necessary, and she assured him, with some confusion, of her
attachment to Mr. Darcy.
“Or, in other words, you are determined to have him. He is rich, to be sure,
and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane. But will they
make you happy?”
“Have you any other objection,” said Elizabeth, “than your belief of my
indifference?”
“None at all. We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but
this would be nothing if you really liked him.”
“I do, I do like him,” she replied, with tears in her eyes, “I love him.
Indeed he has no improper pride. He is perfectly amiable. You do not know
what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms.”
“Lizzy,” said her father, “I have given him my consent. He is the kind of
man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse anything, which he
condescended to ask. I now give it to you, if you are resolved on having him.
But let me advise you to think better of it. I know your disposition, Lizzy. I
know that you could be neither happy nor respectable, unless you truly
esteemed your husband; unless you looked up to him as a superior. Your lively
talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage. You
could scarcely escape discredit and misery. My child, let me not have the grief
of seeing you unable to respect your partner in life. You know not what you
are about.”
Elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply; and at
length, by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was really the object of her
choice, by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had
undergone, relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work
of a day, but had stood the test of many months’ suspense, and enumerating
with energy all his good qualities, she did conquer her father’s incredulity, and
reconcile him to the match.
“Well, my dear,” said he, when she ceased speaking, “I have no more to
say. If this be the case, he deserves you. I could not have parted with you, my
Lizzy, to anyone less worthy.”
To complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr. Darcy
had voluntarily done for Lydia. He heard her with astonishment.
“This is an evening of wonders, indeed! And so, Darcy did every thing;
made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow’s debts, and got him his
commission! So much the better. It will save me a world of trouble and
economy. Had it been your uncle’s doing, I must and would have paid him; but
these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way. I shall offer to pay
him to-morrow; he will rant and storm about his love for you, and there will be
an end of the matter.”
He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his reading
Mr. Collins’s letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her at last to
go—saying, as she quitted the room, “If any young men come for Mary or
Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at leisure.”
Elizabeth’s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after
half an hour’s quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join the others
with tolerable composure. Every thing was too recent for gaiety, but the
evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer anything material to be
dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time.
When her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she followed her,
and made the important communication. Its effect was most extraordinary; for
on first hearing it, Mrs. Bennet sat quite still, and unable to utter a syllable.
Nor was it under many, many minutes that she could comprehend what she
heard; though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of
her family, or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them. She began at
length to recover, to fidget about in her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder,
and bless herself.
“Good gracious! Lord bless me! only think! dear me! Mr. Darcy! Who
would have thought it! And is it really true? Oh! my sweetest Lizzy! how rich
and how great you will be! What pin-money, what jewels, what carriages you
will have! Jane’s is nothing to it—nothing at all. I am so pleased—so happy.
Such a charming man!—so handsome! so tall!—Oh, my dear Lizzy! pray
apologise for my having disliked him so much before. I hope he will overlook
it. Dear, dear Lizzy. A house in town! Every thing that is charming! Three
daughters married! Ten thousand a year! Oh, Lord! What will become of me. I
shall go distracted.”
This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted: and
Elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself, soon went
away. But before she had been three minutes in her own room, her mother
followed her.
“My dearest child,” she cried, “I can think of nothing else! Ten thousand a
year, and very likely more! ‘Tis as good as a Lord! And a special licence. You
must and shall be married by a special licence. But my dearest love, tell me
what dish Mr. Darcy is particularly fond of, that I may have it to-morrow.”
This was a sad omen of what her mother’s behaviour to the gentleman
himself might be; and Elizabeth found that, though in the certain possession of
his warmest affection, and secure of her relations’ consent, there was still
something to be wished for. But the morrow passed off much better than she
expected; for Mrs. Bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son-inlaw that she ventured not to speak to him, unless it was in her power to offer
him any attention, or mark her deference for his opinion.
Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get
acquainted with him; and Mr. Bennet soon assured her that he was rising every
hour in his esteem.
“I admire all my three sons-in-law highly,” said he. “Wickham, perhaps, is
my favourite; but I think I shall like your husband quite as well as Jane’s.”
Chapter 60
Elizabeth’s spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted Mr. Darcy
to account for his having ever fallen in love with her. “How could you begin?”
said she. “I can comprehend your going on charmingly, when you had once
made a beginning; but what could set you off in the first place?”
“I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which laid
the foundation. It is too long ago. I was in the middle before I knew that I had
begun.”
“My beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners—my
behaviour to you was at least always bordering on the uncivil, and I never
spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not. Now be
sincere; did you admire me for my impertinence?”
“For the liveliness of your mind, I did.”
“You may as well call it impertinence at once. It was very little less. The
fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious attention. You
were disgusted with the women who were always speaking, and looking, and
thinking for your approbation alone. I roused, and interested you, because I
was so unlike them. Had you not been really amiable, you would have hated
me for it; but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself, your feelings
were always noble and just; and in your heart, you thoroughly despised the
persons who so assiduously courted you. There—I have saved you the trouble
of accounting for it; and really, all things considered, I begin to think it
perfectly reasonable. To be sure, you knew no actual good of me—but nobody
thinks of that when they fall in love.”
“Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane while she was
ill at Netherfield?”
“Dearest Jane! who could have done less for her? But make a virtue of it
by all means. My good qualities are under your protection, and you are to
exaggerate them as much as possible; and, in return, it belongs to me to find
occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as may be; and I shall
begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point
at last. What made you so shy of me, when you first called, and afterwards
dined here? Why, especially, when you called, did you look as if you did not
care about me?”
“Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement.”
“But I was embarrassed.”
“And so was I.”
“You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner.”
“A man who had felt less, might.”
“How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give, and that I
should be so reasonable as to admit it! But I wonder how long you would have
gone on, if you had been left to yourself. I wonder when you would have
spoken, if I had not asked you! My resolution of thanking you for your
kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect. Too much, I am afraid; for what
becomes of the moral, if our comfort springs from a breach of promise? for I
ought not to have mentioned the subject. This will never do.”
“You need not distress yourself. The moral will be perfectly fair. Lady
Catherine’s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of
removing all my doubts. I am not indebted for my present happiness to your
eager desire of expressing your gratitude. I was not in a humour to wait for
any opening of yours. My aunt’s intelligence had given me hope, and I was
determined at once to know every thing.”
“Lady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy,
for she loves to be of use. But tell me, what did you come down to Netherfield
for? Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed? or had you
intended any more serious consequence?”
“My real purpose was to see you, and to judge, if I could, whether I might
ever hope to make you love me. My avowed one, or what I avowed to myself,
was to see whether your sister were still partial to Bingley, and if she were, to
make the confession to him which I have since made.”
“Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine what is to
befall her?”
“I am more likely to want more time than courage, Elizabeth. But it ought
to be done, and if you will give me a sheet of paper, it shall be done directly.”
“And if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you and admire the
evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did. But I have an aunt,
too, who must not be longer neglected.”
From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr. Darcy
had been over-rated, Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs. Gardiner’s long
letter; but now, having that to communicate which she knew would be most
welcome, she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt had already
lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as follows:
“I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to have done,
for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of particulars; but to say the truth, I was
too cross to write. You supposed more than really existed. But now suppose as
much as you choose; give a loose rein to your fancy, indulge your imagination
in every possible flight which the subject will afford, and unless you believe
me actually married, you cannot greatly err. You must write again very soon,
and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last. I thank you, again
and again, for not going to the Lakes. How could I be so silly as to wish it!
Your idea of the ponies is delightful. We will go round the Park every day. I
am the happiest creature in the world. Perhaps other people have said so
before, but not one with such justice. I am happier even than Jane; she only
smiles, I laugh. Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the world that he can spare
from me. You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas. Yours, etc.”
Mr. Darcy’s letter to Lady Catherine was in a different style; and still
different from either was what Mr. Bennet sent to Mr. Collins, in reply to his
last.
“DEAR SIR,
“I must trouble you once more for congratulations. Elizabeth will soon be
the wife of Mr. Darcy. Console Lady Catherine as well as you can. But, if I
were you, I would stand by the nephew. He has more to give.
“Yours sincerely, etc.”
Miss Bingley’s congratulations to her brother, on his approaching
marriage, were all that was affectionate and insincere. She wrote even to Jane
on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all her former professions of
regard. Jane was not deceived, but she was affected; and though feeling no
reliance on her, could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she
knew was deserved.
The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information, was
as sincere as her brother’s in sending it. Four sides of paper were insufficient
to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister.
Before any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins, or any congratulations to
Elizabeth from his wife, the Longbourn family heard that the Collinses were
come themselves to Lucas Lodge. The reason of this sudden removal was soon
evident. Lady Catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the
contents of her nephew’s letter, that Charlotte, really rejoicing in the match,
was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over. At such a moment, the
arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in the course
of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when
she saw Mr. Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her
husband. He bore it, however, with admirable calmness. He could even listen
to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away the
brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their all meeting
frequently at St. James’s, with very decent composure. If he did shrug his
shoulders, it was not till Sir William was out of sight.
Mrs. Phillips’s vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater, tax on his
forbearance; and though Mrs. Phillips, as well as her sister, stood in too much
awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley’s good humour
encouraged, yet, whenever she did speak, she must be vulgar. Nor was her
respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at all likely to make her more
elegant. Elizabeth did all she could to shield him from the frequent notice of
either, and was ever anxious to keep him to herself, and to those of her family
with whom he might converse without mortification; and though the
uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship
much of its pleasure, it added to the hope of the future; and she looked forward
with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little
pleasing to either, to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at
Pemberley.
Chapter 61
Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs. Bennet got
rid of her two most deserving daughters. With what delighted pride she
afterwards visited Mrs. Bingley, and talked of Mrs. Darcy, may be guessed. I
wish I could say, for the sake of her family, that the accomplishment of her
earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children produced so
happy an effect as to make her a sensible, amiable, well-informed woman for
the rest of her life; though perhaps it was lucky for her husband, who might
not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form, that she still was
occasionally nervous and invariably silly.
Mr. Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for her
drew him oftener from home than anything else could do. He delighted in
going to Pemberley, especially when he was least expected.
Mr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth. So near
a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to his
easy temper, or her affectionate heart. The darling wish of his sisters was then
gratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to Derbyshire, and Jane
and Elizabeth, in addition to every other source of happiness, were within
thirty miles of each other.
Kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time with her
two elder sisters. In society so superior to what she had generally known, her
improvement was great. She was not of so ungovernable a temper as Lydia;
and, removed from the influence of Lydia’s example, she became, by proper
attention and management, less irritable, less ignorant, and less insipid. From
the further disadvantage of Lydia’s society she was of course carefully kept,
and though Mrs. Wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her,
with the promise of balls and young men, her father would never consent to
her going.
Mary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was
necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs. Bennet’s
being quite unable to sit alone. Mary was obliged to mix more with the world,
but she could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no longer
mortified by comparisons between her sisters’ beauty and her own, it was
suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much
reluctance.
As for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from
the marriage of her sisters. He bore with philosophy the conviction that
Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and
falsehood had before been unknown to her; and in spite of every thing, was
not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his
fortune. The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received from Lydia on her
marriage, explained to her that, by his wife at least, if not by himself, such a
hope was cherished. The letter was to this effect:
“MY DEAR LIZZY,
“I wish you joy. If you love Mr. Darcy half as well as I do my dear
Wickham, you must be very happy. It is a great comfort to have you so rich,
and when you have nothing else to do, I hope you will think of us. I am sure
Wickham would like a place at court very much, and I do not think we shall
have quite money enough to live upon without some help. Any place would
do, of about three or four hundred a year; but however, do not speak to Mr.
Darcy about it, if you had rather not.
“Yours, etc.”
As it happened that Elizabeth had much rather not, she endeavoured in her
answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind. Such relief,
however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice of what might be
called economy in her own private expences, she frequently sent them. It had
always been evident to her that such an income as theirs, under the direction of
two persons so extravagant in their wants, and heedless of the future, must be
very insufficient to their support; and whenever they changed their quarters,
either Jane or herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance
towards discharging their bills. Their manner of living, even when the
restoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the extreme.
They were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation,
and always spending more than they ought. His affection for her soon sunk
into indifference; hers lasted a little longer; and in spite of her youth and her
manners, she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had
given her.
Though Darcy could never receive him at Pemberley, yet, for Elizabeth’s
sake, he assisted him further in his profession. Lydia was occasionally a visitor
there, when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in London or Bath; and
with the Bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long, that even
Bingley’s good humour was overcome, and he proceeded so far as to talk of
giving them a hint to be gone.
Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy’s marriage; but as she
thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley, she dropt all
her resentment; was fonder than ever of Georgiana, almost as attentive to
Darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility to Elizabeth.
Pemberley was now Georgiana’s home; and the attachment of the sisters
was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see. They were able to love each other
even as well as they intended. Georgiana had the highest opinion in the world
of Elizabeth; though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering
on alarm at her lively, sportive, manner of talking to her brother. He, who had
always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection, she
now saw the object of open pleasantry. Her mind received knowledge which
had never before fallen in her way. By Elizabeth’s instructions, she began to
comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband which a brother
will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself.
Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew;
and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character in her reply
to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him language so very
abusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for some time all intercourse was at an
end. But at length, by Elizabeth’s persuasion, he was prevailed on to overlook
the offence, and seek a reconciliation; and, after a little further resistance on
the part of his aunt, her resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or
her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to
wait on them at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had
received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the visits of her
uncle and aunt from the city.
With the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate terms. Darcy, as
well as Elizabeth, really loved them; and they were both ever sensible of the
warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing her into Derbyshire,
had been the means of uniting them.

                **SHAKESPEARE**



O for a Muse of fire, that would ascend
The brightest heaven of invention,
A kingdom for a stage, princes to act
And monarchs to behold the swelling scene!
Then should the warlike Harry, like himself,
Assume the port of Mars; and at his heels,
Leash'd in like hounds, should famine, sword and fire
Crouch for employment. But pardon, and gentles all,
The flat unraised spirits that have dared
On this unworthy scaffold to bring forth
So great an object: can this cockpit hold
The vasty fields of France? or may we cram
Within this wooden O the very casques
That did affright the air at Agincourt?
O, pardon! since a crooked figure may
Attest in little place a million;
And let us, ciphers to this great accompt,
On your imaginary forces work.
Suppose within the girdle of these walls
Are now confined two mighty monarchies,
Whose high upreared and abutting fronts
The perilous narrow ocean parts asunder:
Piece out our imperfections with your thoughts;
Into a thousand parts divide on man,
And make imaginary puissance;
Think when we talk of horses, that you see them
Printing their proud hoofs i' the receiving earth;
For 'tis your thoughts that now must deck our kings,
Carry them here and there; jumping o'er times,
Turning the accomplishment of many years
Into an hour-glass: for the which supply,
Admit me Chorus to this history;
Who prologue-like your humble patience pray,
Gently to hear, kindly to judge, our play.
Exit
SCENE I. London. An ante-chamber in the KING'S palace.
Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY, and the BISHOP OF ELY 
CANTERBURY 
My lord, I'll tell you; that self bill is urged,
Which in the eleventh year of the last king's reign
Was like, and had indeed against us pass'd,
But that the scambling and unquiet time
Did push it out of farther question.
ELY 
But how, my lord, shall we resist it now?
CANTERBURY 
It must be thought on. If it pass against us,
We lose the better half of our possession:
For all the temporal lands which men devout
By testament have given to the church
Would they strip from us; being valued thus:
As much as would maintain, to the king's honour,
Full fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights,
Six thousand and two hundred good esquires;
And, to relief of lazars and weak age,
Of indigent faint souls past corporal toil.
A hundred almshouses right well supplied;
And to the coffers of the king beside,
A thousand pounds by the year: thus runs the bill.
ELY 
This would drink deep.
CANTERBURY 
'Twould drink the cup and all.
ELY 
But what prevention?
CANTERBURY 
The king is full of grace and fair regard.
ELY 
And a true lover of the holy church.
CANTERBURY 
The courses of his youth promised it not.
The breath no sooner left his father's body,
But that his wildness, mortified in him,
Seem'd to die too; yea, at that very moment
Consideration, like an angel, came
And whipp'd the offending Adam out of him,
Leaving his body as a paradise,
To envelop and contain celestial spirits.
Never was such a sudden scholar made;
Never came reformation in a flood,
With such a heady currance, scouring faults
Nor never Hydra-headed wilfulness
So soon did lose his seat and all at once
As in this king.
ELY 
We are blessed in the change.
CANTERBURY 
Hear him but reason in divinity,
And all-admiring with an inward wish
You would desire the king were made a prelate:
Hear him debate of commonwealth affairs,
You would say it hath been all in all his study:
List his discourse of war, and you shall hear
A fearful battle render'd you in music:
Turn him to any cause of policy,
The Gordian knot of it he will unloose,
Familiar as his garter: that, when he speaks,
The air, a charter'd libertine, is still,
And the mute wonder lurketh in men's ears,
To steal his sweet and honey'd sentences;
So that the art and practic part of life
Must be the mistress to this theoric:
Which is a wonder how his grace should glean it,
Since his addiction was to courses vain,
His companies unletter'd, rude and shallow,
His hours fill'd up with riots, banquets, sports,
And never noted in him any study,
Any retirement, any sequestration
From open haunts and popularity.
ELY 
The strawberry grows underneath the nettle
And wholesome berries thrive and ripen best
Neighbour'd by fruit of baser quality:
And so the prince obscured his contemplation
Under the veil of wildness; which, no doubt,
Grew like the summer grass, fastest by night,
Unseen, yet crescive in his faculty.
CANTERBURY 
It must be so; for miracles are ceased;
And therefore we must needs admit the means
How things are perfected.
ELY 
But, my good lord,
How now for mitigation of this bill
Urged by the commons? Doth his majesty
Incline to it, or no?
CANTERBURY 
He seems indifferent,
Or rather swaying more upon our part
Than cherishing the exhibiters against us;
For I have made an offer to his majesty,
Upon our spiritual convocation
And in regard of causes now in hand,
Which I have open'd to his grace at large,
As touching France, to give a greater sum
Than ever at one time the clergy yet
Did to his predecessors part withal.
ELY 
How did this offer seem received, my lord?
CANTERBURY 
With good acceptance of his majesty;
Save that there was not time enough to hear,
As I perceived his grace would fain have done,
The severals and unhidden passages
Of his true titles to some certain dukedoms
And generally to the crown and seat of France
Derived from Edward, his great-grandfather.
ELY 
What was the impediment that broke this off?
CANTERBURY 
The French ambassador upon that instant
Craved audience; and the hour, I think, is come
To give him hearing: is it four o'clock?
ELY 
It is.
CANTERBURY 
Then go we in, to know his embassy;
Which I could with a ready guess declare,
Before the Frenchman speak a word of it.
ELY 
I'll wait upon you, and I long to hear it.
Exeunt
SCENE II. The same. The Presence chamber.
Enter KING HENRY V, GLOUCESTER, BEDFORD, EXETER, WARWICK, WESTMORELAND, and Attendants 
KING HENRY V 
Where is my gracious Lord of Canterbury?
EXETER 
Not here in presence.
KING HENRY V 
Send for him, good uncle.
WESTMORELAND 
Shall we call in the ambassador, my liege?
KING HENRY V 
Not yet, my cousin: we would be resolved,
Before we hear him, of some things of weight
That task our thoughts, concerning us and France.
Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY, and the BISHOP of ELY
CANTERBURY 
God and his angels guard your sacred throne
And make you long become it!
KING HENRY V 
Sure, we thank you.
My learned lord, we pray you to proceed
And justly and religiously unfold
Why the law Salique that they have in France
Or should, or should not, bar us in our claim:
And God forbid, my dear and faithful lord,
That you should fashion, wrest, or bow your reading,
Or nicely charge your understanding soul
With opening titles miscreate, whose right
Suits not in native colours with the truth;
For God doth know how many now in health
Shall drop their blood in approbation
Of what your reverence shall incite us to.
Therefore take heed how you impawn our person,
How you awake our sleeping sword of war:
We charge you, in the name of God, take heed;
For never two such kingdoms did contend
Without much fall of blood; whose guiltless drops
Are every one a woe, a sore complaint
'Gainst him whose wrong gives edge unto the swords
That make such waste in brief mortality.
Under this conjuration, speak, my lord;
For we will hear, note and believe in heart
That what you speak is in your conscience wash'd
As pure as sin with baptism.
CANTERBURY 
Then hear me, gracious sovereign, and you peers,
That owe yourselves, your lives and services
To this imperial throne. There is no bar
To make against your highness' claim to France
But this, which they produce from Pharamond,
'In terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant:'
'No woman shall succeed in Salique land:'
Which Salique land the French unjustly gloze
To be the realm of France, and Pharamond
The founder of this law and female bar.
Yet their own authors faithfully affirm
That the land Salique is in Germany,
Between the floods of Sala and of Elbe;
Where Charles the Great, having subdued the Saxons,
There left behind and settled certain French;
Who, holding in disdain the German women
For some dishonest manners of their life,
Establish'd then this law; to wit, no female
Should be inheritrix in Salique land:
Which Salique, as I said, 'twixt Elbe and Sala,
Is at this day in Germany call'd Meisen.
Then doth it well appear that Salique law
Was not devised for the realm of France:
Nor did the French possess the Salique land
Until four hundred one and twenty years
After defunction of King Pharamond,
Idly supposed the founder of this law;
Who died within the year of our redemption
Four hundred twenty-six; and Charles the Great
Subdued the Saxons, and did seat the French
Beyond the river Sala, in the year
Eight hundred five. Besides, their writers say,
King Pepin, which deposed Childeric,
Did, as heir general, being descended
Of Blithild, which was daughter to King Clothair,
Make claim and title to the crown of France.
Hugh Capet also, who usurped the crown
Of Charles the duke of Lorraine, sole heir male
Of the true line and stock of Charles the Great,
To find his title with some shows of truth,
'Through, in pure truth, it was corrupt and naught,
Convey'd himself as heir to the Lady Lingare,
Daughter to Charlemain, who was the son
To Lewis the emperor, and Lewis the son
Of Charles the Great. Also King Lewis the Tenth,
Who was sole heir to the usurper Capet,
Could not keep quiet in his conscience,
Wearing the crown of France, till satisfied
That fair Queen Isabel, his grandmother,
Was lineal of the Lady Ermengare,
Daughter to Charles the foresaid duke of Lorraine:
By the which marriage the line of Charles the Great
Was re-united to the crown of France.
So that, as clear as is the summer's sun.
King Pepin's title and Hugh Capet's claim,
King Lewis his satisfaction, all appear
To hold in right and title of the female:
So do the kings of France unto this day;
Howbeit they would hold up this Salique law
To bar your highness claiming from the female,
And rather choose to hide them in a net
Than amply to imbar their crooked titles
Usurp'd from you and your progenitors.
KING HENRY V 
May I with right and conscience make this claim?
CANTERBURY 
The sin upon my head, dread sovereign!
For in the book of Numbers is it writ,
When the man dies, let the inheritance
Descend unto the daughter. Gracious lord,
Stand for your own; unwind your bloody flag;
Look back into your mighty ancestors:
Go, my dread lord, to your great-grandsire's tomb,
From whom you claim; invoke his warlike spirit,
And your great-uncle's, Edward the Black Prince,
Who on the French ground play'd a tragedy,
Making defeat on the full power of France,
Whiles his most mighty father on a hill
Stood smiling to behold his lion's whelp
Forage in blood of French nobility.
O noble English. that could entertain
With half their forces the full Pride of France
And let another half stand laughing by,
All out of work and cold for action!
ELY 
Awake remembrance of these valiant dead
And with your puissant arm renew their feats:
You are their heir; you sit upon their throne;
The blood and courage that renowned them
Runs in your veins; and my thrice-puissant liege
Is in the very May-morn of his youth,
Ripe for exploits and mighty enterprises.
EXETER 
Your brother kings and monarchs of the earth
Do all expect that you should rouse yourself,
As did the former lions of your blood.
WESTMORELAND 
They know your grace hath cause and means and might;
So hath your highness; never king of England
Had nobles richer and more loyal subjects,
Whose hearts have left their bodies here in England
And lie pavilion'd in the fields of France.
CANTERBURY 
O, let their bodies follow, my dear liege,
With blood and sword and fire to win your right;
In aid whereof we of the spiritualty
Will raise your highness such a mighty sum
As never did the clergy at one time
Bring in to any of your ancestors.
KING HENRY V 
We must not only arm to invade the French,
But lay down our proportions to defend
Against the Scot, who will make road upon us
With all advantages.
CANTERBURY 
They of those marches, gracious sovereign,
Shall be a wall sufficient to defend
Our inland from the pilfering borderers.
KING HENRY V 
We do not mean the coursing snatchers only,
But fear the main intendment of the Scot,
Who hath been still a giddy neighbour to us;
For you shall read that my great-grandfather
Never went with his forces into France
But that the Scot on his unfurnish'd kingdom
Came pouring, like the tide into a breach,
With ample and brim fulness of his force,
Galling the gleaned land with hot assays,
Girding with grievous siege castles and towns;
That England, being empty of defence,
Hath shook and trembled at the ill neighbourhood.
CANTERBURY 
She hath been then more fear'd than harm'd, my liege;
For hear her but exampled by herself:
When all her chivalry hath been in France
And she a mourning widow of her nobles,
She hath herself not only well defended
But taken and impounded as a stray
The King of Scots; whom she did send to France,
To fill King Edward's fame with prisoner kings
And make her chronicle as rich with praise
As is the ooze and bottom of the sea
With sunken wreck and sunless treasuries.
WESTMORELAND 
But there's a saying very old and true,
'If that you will France win,
Then with Scotland first begin:'
For once the eagle England being in prey,
To her unguarded nest the weasel Scot
Comes sneaking and so sucks her princely eggs,
Playing the mouse in absence of the cat,
To tear and havoc more than she can eat.
EXETER 
It follows then the cat must stay at home:
Yet that is but a crush'd necessity,
Since we have locks to safeguard necessaries,
And pretty traps to catch the petty thieves.
While that the armed hand doth fight abroad,
The advised head defends itself at home;
For government, though high and low and lower,
Put into parts, doth keep in one consent,
Congreeing in a full and natural close,
Like music.
CANTERBURY 
Therefore doth heaven divide
The state of man in divers functions,
Setting endeavour in continual motion;
To which is fixed, as an aim or butt,
Obedience: for so work the honey-bees,
Creatures that by a rule in nature teach
The act of order to a peopled kingdom.
They have a king and officers of sorts;
Where some, like magistrates, correct at home,
Others, like merchants, venture trade abroad,
Others, like soldiers, armed in their stings,
Make boot upon the summer's velvet buds,
Which pillage they with merry march bring home
To the tent-royal of their emperor;
Who, busied in his majesty, surveys
The singing masons building roofs of gold,
The civil citizens kneading up the honey,
The poor mechanic porters crowding in
Their heavy burdens at his narrow gate,
The sad-eyed justice, with his surly hum,
Delivering o'er to executors pale
The lazy yawning drone. I this infer,
That many things, having full reference
To one consent, may work contrariously:
As many arrows, loosed several ways,
Come to one mark; as many ways meet in one town;
As many fresh streams meet in one salt sea;
As many lines close in the dial's centre;
So may a thousand actions, once afoot.
End in one purpose, and be all well borne
Without defeat. Therefore to France, my liege.
Divide your happy England into four;
Whereof take you one quarter into France,
And you withal shall make all Gallia shake.
If we, with thrice such powers left at home,
Cannot defend our own doors from the dog,
Let us be worried and our nation lose
The name of hardiness and policy.
KING HENRY V 
Call in the messengers sent from the Dauphin.
Exeunt some Attendants
Now are we well resolved; and, by God's help,
And yours, the noble sinews of our power,
France being ours, we'll bend it to our awe,
Or break it all to pieces: or there we'll sit,
Ruling in large and ample empery
O'er France and all her almost kingly dukedoms,
Or lay these bones in an unworthy urn,
Tombless, with no remembrance over them:
Either our history shall with full mouth
Speak freely of our acts, or else our grave,
Like Turkish mute, shall have a tongueless mouth,
Not worshipp'd with a waxen epitaph.
Enter Ambassadors of France
Now are we well prepared to know the pleasure
Of our fair cousin Dauphin; for we hear
Your greeting is from him, not from the king.
First Ambassador 
May't please your majesty to give us leave
Freely to render what we have in charge;
Or shall we sparingly show you far off
The Dauphin's meaning and our embassy?
KING HENRY V 
We are no tyrant, but a Christian king;
Unto whose grace our passion is as subject
As are our wretches fetter'd in our prisons:
Therefore with frank and with uncurbed plainness
Tell us the Dauphin's mind.
First Ambassador 
Thus, then, in few.
Your highness, lately sending into France,
Did claim some certain dukedoms, in the right
Of your great predecessor, King Edward the Third.
In answer of which claim, the prince our master
Says that you savour too much of your youth,
And bids you be advised there's nought in France
That can be with a nimble galliard won;
You cannot revel into dukedoms there.
He therefore sends you, meeter for your spirit,
This tun of treasure; and, in lieu of this,
Desires you let the dukedoms that you claim
Hear no more of you. This the Dauphin speaks.
KING HENRY V 
What treasure, uncle?
Tennis-balls, my liege.
KING HENRY V 
We are glad the Dauphin is so pleasant with us;
His present and your pains we thank you for:
When we have march'd our rackets to these balls,
We will, in France, by God's grace, play a set
Shall strike his father's crown into the hazard.
Tell him he hath made a match with such a wrangler
That all the courts of France will be disturb'd
With chaces. And we understand him well,
How he comes o'er us with our wilder days,
Not measuring what use we made of them.
We never valued this poor seat of England;
And therefore, living hence, did give ourself
To barbarous licence; as 'tis ever common
That men are merriest when they are from home.
But tell the Dauphin I will keep my state,
Be like a king and show my sail of greatness
When I do rouse me in my throne of France:
For that I have laid by my majesty
And plodded like a man for working-days,
But I will rise there with so full a glory
That I will dazzle all the eyes of France,
Yea, strike the Dauphin blind to look on us.
And tell the pleasant prince this mock of his
Hath turn'd his balls to gun-stones; and his soul
Shall stand sore charged for the wasteful vengeance
That shall fly with them: for many a thousand widows
Shall this his mock mock out of their dear husbands;
Mock mothers from their sons, mock castles down;
And some are yet ungotten and unborn
That shall have cause to curse the Dauphin's scorn.
But this lies all within the will of God,
To whom I do appeal; and in whose name
Tell you the Dauphin I am coming on,
To venge me as I may and to put forth
My rightful hand in a well-hallow'd cause.
So get you hence in peace; and tell the Dauphin
His jest will savour but of shallow wit,
When thousands weep more than did laugh at it.
Convey them with safe conduct. Fare you well.
KING HENRY V 
We hope to make the sender blush at it.
Therefore, my lords, omit no happy hour
That may give furtherance to our expedition;
For we have now no thought in us but France,
Save those to God, that run before our business.
Therefore let our proportions for these wars
Be soon collected and all things thought upon
That may with reasonable swiftness add
More feathers to our wings; for, God before,
We'll chide this Dauphin at his father's door.
Therefore let every man now task his thought,
That this fair action may on foot be brought.

Is it for fear to wet a widow's eye,
  That thou consum'st thy self in single life?
  Ah, if thou issueless shalt hap to die,
  The world will wail thee like a makeless wife,
  The world will be thy widow and still weep,
  That thou no form of thee hast left behind,
  When every private widow well may keep,
  By children's eyes, her husband's shape in mind:
  Look what an unthrift in the world doth spend
  Shifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it;
  But beauty's waste hath in the world an end,
  And kept unused the user so destroys it:
    No love toward others in that bosom sits
    That on himself such murd'rous shame commits.


                     10
  For shame deny that thou bear'st love to any
  Who for thy self art so unprovident.
  Grant if thou wilt, thou art beloved of many,
  But that thou none lov'st is most evident:
  For thou art so possessed with murd'rous hate,
  That 'gainst thy self thou stick'st not to conspire,
  Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate
  Which to repair should be thy chief desire:
  O change thy thought, that I may change my mind,
  Shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love?
  Be as thy presence is gracious and kind,
  Or to thy self at least kind-hearted prove,
    Make thee another self for love of me,
    That beauty still may live in thine or thee.


                     11
  As fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou grow'st,
  In one of thine, from that which thou departest,
  And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow'st,
  Thou mayst call thine, when thou from youth convertest,
  Herein lives wisdom, beauty, and increase,
  Without this folly, age, and cold decay,
  If all were minded so, the times should cease,
  And threescore year would make the world away:
  Let those whom nature hath not made for store,
  Harsh, featureless, and rude, barrenly perish:
  Look whom she best endowed, she gave thee more;
  Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish:
    She carved thee for her seal, and meant thereby,
    Thou shouldst print more, not let that copy die.


                     12
  When I do count the clock that tells the time,
  And see the brave day sunk in hideous night,
  When I behold the violet past prime,
  And sable curls all silvered o'er with white:
  When lofty trees I see barren of leaves,
  Which erst from heat did canopy the herd
  And summer's green all girded up in sheaves
  Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard:
  Then of thy beauty do I question make
  That thou among the wastes of time must go,
  Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake,
  And die as fast as they see others grow,
    And nothing 'gainst Time's scythe can make defence
    Save breed to brave him, when he takes thee hence.


                     13
  O that you were your self, but love you are
  No longer yours, than you your self here live,
  Against this coming end you should prepare,
  And your sweet semblance to some other give.
  So should that beauty which you hold in lease
  Find no determination, then you were
  Your self again after your self's decease,
  When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear.
  Who lets so fair a house fall to decay,
  Which husbandry in honour might uphold,
  Against the stormy gusts of winter's day
  And barren rage of death's eternal cold?
    O none but unthrifts, dear my love you know,
    You had a father, let your son say so.


                     14
  Not from the stars do I my judgement pluck,
  And yet methinks I have astronomy,
  But not to tell of good, or evil luck,
  Of plagues, of dearths, or seasons' quality,
  Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell;
  Pointing to each his thunder, rain and wind,
  Or say with princes if it shall go well
  By oft predict that I in heaven find.
  But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive,
  And constant stars in them I read such art
  As truth and beauty shall together thrive
  If from thy self, to store thou wouldst convert:
    Or else of thee this I prognosticate,
    Thy end is truth's and beauty's doom and date.


                     15
  When I consider every thing that grows
  Holds in perfection but a little moment.
  That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows
  Whereon the stars in secret influence comment.
  When I perceive that men as plants increase,
  Cheered and checked even by the self-same sky:
  Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,
  And wear their brave state out of memory.
  Then the conceit of this inconstant stay,
  Sets you most rich in youth before my sight,
  Where wasteful time debateth with decay
  To change your day of youth to sullied night,
    And all in war with Time for love of you,
    As he takes from you, I engraft you new.


                     16
  But wherefore do not you a mightier way
  Make war upon this bloody tyrant Time?
  And fortify your self in your decay
  With means more blessed than my barren rhyme?
  Now stand you on the top of happy hours,
  And many maiden gardens yet unset,
  With virtuous wish would bear you living flowers,
  Much liker than your painted counterfeit:
  So should the lines of life that life repair
  Which this (Time's pencil) or my pupil pen
  Neither in inward worth nor outward fair
  Can make you live your self in eyes of men.
    To give away your self, keeps your self still,
    And you must live drawn by your own sweet skill.


                     17
  Who will believe my verse in time to come
  If it were filled with your most high deserts?
  Though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb
  Which hides your life, and shows not half your parts:
  If I could write the beauty of your eyes,
  And in fresh numbers number all your graces,
  The age to come would say this poet lies,
  Such heavenly touches ne'er touched earthly faces.
  So should my papers (yellowed with their age)
  Be scorned, like old men of less truth than tongue,
  And your true rights be termed a poet's rage,
  And stretched metre of an antique song.
    But were some child of yours alive that time,
    You should live twice in it, and in my rhyme.


                     18
  Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
  Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
  Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
  And summer's lease hath all too short a date:
  Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
  And often is his gold complexion dimmed,
  And every fair from fair sometime declines,
  By chance, or nature's changing course untrimmed:
  But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
  Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st,
  Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
  When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st,
    So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,
    So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.


                     19
  Devouring Time blunt thou the lion's paws,
  And make the earth devour her own sweet brood,
  Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger's jaws,
  And burn the long-lived phoenix, in her blood,
  Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleet'st,
  And do whate'er thou wilt swift-footed Time
  To the wide world and all her fading sweets:
  But I forbid thee one most heinous crime,
  O carve not with thy hours my love's fair brow,
  Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen,
  Him in thy course untainted do allow,
  For beauty's pattern to succeeding men.
    Yet do thy worst old Time: despite thy wrong,
    My love shall in my verse ever live young.


                     20
  A woman's face with nature's own hand painted,
  Hast thou the master mistress of my passion,
  A woman's gentle heart but not acquainted
  With shifting change as is false women's fashion,
  An eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling:
  Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth,
  A man in hue all hues in his controlling,
  Which steals men's eyes and women's souls amazeth.
  And for a woman wert thou first created,
  Till nature as she wrought thee fell a-doting,
  And by addition me of thee defeated,
  By adding one thing to my purpose nothing.
    But since she pricked thee out for women's pleasure,
    Mine be thy love and thy love's use their treasure.


                     21
  So is it not with me as with that muse,
  Stirred by a painted beauty to his verse,
  Who heaven it self for ornament doth use,
  And every fair with his fair doth rehearse,
  Making a couplement of proud compare
  With sun and moon, with earth and sea's rich gems:
  With April's first-born flowers and all things rare,
  That heaven's air in this huge rondure hems.
  O let me true in love but truly write,
  And then believe me, my love is as fair,
  As any mother's child, though not so bright
  As those gold candles fixed in heaven's air:
    Let them say more that like of hearsay well,
    I will not praise that purpose not to sell.


                     22
  My glass shall not persuade me I am old,
  So long as youth and thou are of one date,
  But when in thee time's furrows I behold,
  Then look I death my days should expiate.
  For all that beauty that doth cover thee,
  Is but the seemly raiment of my heart,
  Which in thy breast doth live, as thine in me,
  How can I then be elder than thou art?
  O therefore love be of thyself so wary,
  As I not for my self, but for thee will,
  Bearing thy heart which I will keep so chary
  As tender nurse her babe from faring ill.
    Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain,
    Thou gav'st me thine not to give back again.


                     23
  As an unperfect actor on the stage,
  Who with his fear is put beside his part,
  Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage,
  Whose strength's abundance weakens his own heart;
  So I for fear of trust, forget to say,
  The perfect ceremony of love's rite,
  And in mine own love's strength seem to decay,
  O'ercharged with burthen of mine own love's might:
  O let my looks be then the eloquence,
  And dumb presagers of my speaking breast,
  Who plead for love, and look for recompense,
  More than that tongue that more hath more expressed.
    O learn to read what silent love hath writ,
    To hear with eyes belongs to love's fine wit.


                     24
  Mine eye hath played the painter and hath stelled,
  Thy beauty's form in table of my heart,
  My body is the frame wherein 'tis held,
  And perspective it is best painter's art.
  For through the painter must you see his skill,
  To find where your true image pictured lies,
  Which in my bosom's shop is hanging still,
  That hath his windows glazed with thine eyes:
  Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done,
  Mine eyes have drawn thy shape, and thine for me
  Are windows to my breast, where-through the sun
  Delights to peep, to gaze therein on thee;
    Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art,
    They draw but what they see, know not the heart.


                     25
  Let those who are in favour with their stars,
  Of public honour and proud titles boast,
  Whilst I whom fortune of such triumph bars
  Unlooked for joy in that I honour most;
  Great princes' favourites their fair leaves spread,
  But as the marigold at the sun's eye,
  And in themselves their pride lies buried,
  For at a frown they in their glory die.
  The painful warrior famoused for fight,
  After a thousand victories once foiled,
  Is from the book of honour razed quite,
  And all the rest forgot for which he toiled:
    Then happy I that love and am beloved
    Where I may not remove nor be removed.


                     26
  Lord of my love, to whom in vassalage
  Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit;
  To thee I send this written embassage
  To witness duty, not to show my wit.
  Duty so great, which wit so poor as mine
  May make seem bare, in wanting words to show it;
  But that I hope some good conceit of thine
  In thy soul's thought (all naked) will bestow it:
  Till whatsoever star that guides my moving,
  Points on me graciously with fair aspect,
  And puts apparel on my tattered loving,
  To show me worthy of thy sweet respect,
    Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee,
    Till then, not show my head where thou mayst prove me.


                     27
  Weary with toil, I haste me to my bed,
  The dear respose for limbs with travel tired,
  But then begins a journey in my head
  To work my mind, when body's work's expired.
  For then my thoughts (from far where I abide)
  Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee,
  And keep my drooping eyelids open wide,
  Looking on darkness which the blind do see.
  Save that my soul's imaginary sight
  Presents thy shadow to my sightless view,
  Which like a jewel (hung in ghastly night)
  Makes black night beauteous, and her old face new.
    Lo thus by day my limbs, by night my mind,
    For thee, and for my self, no quiet find.


                     28
  How can I then return in happy plight
  That am debarred the benefit of rest?
  When day's oppression is not eased by night,
  But day by night and night by day oppressed.
  And each (though enemies to either's reign)
  Do in consent shake hands to torture me,
  The one by toil, the other to complain
  How far I toil, still farther off from thee.
  I tell the day to please him thou art bright,
  And dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven:
  So flatter I the swart-complexioned night,
  When sparkling stars twire not thou gild'st the even.
    But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer,
    And night doth nightly make grief's length seem stronger


                     29
  When in disgrace with Fortune and men's eyes,
  I all alone beweep my outcast state,
  And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,
  And look upon my self and curse my fate,
  Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,
  Featured like him, like him with friends possessed,
  Desiring this man's art, and that man's scope,
  With what I most enjoy contented least,
  Yet in these thoughts my self almost despising,
  Haply I think on thee, and then my state,
  (Like to the lark at break of day arising
  From sullen earth) sings hymns at heaven's gate,
    For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings,
    That then I scorn to change my state with kings.


                     30
  When to the sessions of sweet silent thought,
  I summon up remembrance of things past,
  I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,
  And with old woes new wail my dear time's waste:
  Then can I drown an eye (unused to flow)
  For precious friends hid in death's dateless night,
  And weep afresh love's long since cancelled woe,
  And moan th' expense of many a vanished sight.
  Then can I grieve at grievances foregone,
  And heavily from woe to woe tell o'er
  The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,
  Which I new pay as if not paid before.
    But if the while I think on thee (dear friend)
    All losses are restored, and sorrows end.


                     31
  Thy bosom is endeared with all hearts,
  Which I by lacking have supposed dead,
  And there reigns love and all love's loving parts,
  And all those friends which I thought buried.
  How many a holy and obsequious tear
  Hath dear religious love stol'n from mine eye,
  As interest of the dead, which now appear,
  But things removed that hidden in thee lie.
  Thou art the grave where buried love doth live,
  Hung with the trophies of my lovers gone,
  Who all their parts of me to thee did give,
  That due of many, now is thine alone.
    Their images I loved, I view in thee,
    And thou (all they) hast all the all of me.


                     32
  If thou survive my well-contented day,
  When that churl death my bones with dust shall cover
  And shalt by fortune once more re-survey
  These poor rude lines of thy deceased lover:
  Compare them with the bett'ring of the time,
  And though they be outstripped by every pen,
  Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,
  Exceeded by the height of happier men.
  O then vouchsafe me but this loving thought,
  'Had my friend's Muse grown with this growing age,
  A dearer birth than this his love had brought
  To march in ranks of better equipage:
    But since he died and poets better prove,
    Theirs for their style I'll read, his for his love'.


                     33
  Full many a glorious morning have I seen,
  Flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye,
  Kissing with golden face the meadows green;
  Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy:
  Anon permit the basest clouds to ride,
  With ugly rack on his celestial face,
  And from the forlorn world his visage hide
  Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace:
  Even so my sun one early morn did shine,
  With all triumphant splendour on my brow,
  But out alack, he was but one hour mine,
  The region cloud hath masked him from me now.
    Yet him for this, my love no whit disdaineth,
    Suns of the world may stain, when heaven's sun staineth.


                     34
  Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day,
  And make me travel forth without my cloak,
  To let base clouds o'ertake me in my way,
  Hiding thy brav'ry in their rotten smoke?
  'Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break,
  To dry the rain on my storm-beaten face,
  For no man well of such a salve can speak,
  That heals the wound, and cures not the disgrace:
  Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief,
  Though thou repent, yet I have still the loss,
  Th' offender's sorrow lends but weak relief
  To him that bears the strong offence's cross.
    Ah but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds,
    And they are rich, and ransom all ill deeds.


                     35
  No more be grieved at that which thou hast done,
  Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud,
  Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun,
  And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud.
  All men make faults, and even I in this,
  Authorizing thy trespass with compare,
  My self corrupting salving thy amiss,
  Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are:
  For to thy sensual fault I bring in sense,
  Thy adverse party is thy advocate,
  And 'gainst my self a lawful plea commence:
  Such civil war is in my love and hate,
    That I an accessary needs must be,
    To that sweet thief which sourly robs from me.


                     36
  Let me confess that we two must be twain,
  Although our undivided loves are one:
  So shall those blots that do with me remain,
  Without thy help, by me be borne alone.
  In our two loves there is but one respect,
  Though in our lives a separable spite,
  Which though it alter not love's sole effect,
  Yet doth it steal sweet hours from love's delight.
  I may not evermore acknowledge thee,
  Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame,
  Nor thou with public kindness honour me,
  Unless thou take that honour from thy name:
    But do not so, I love thee in such sort,
    As thou being mine, mine is thy good report.


                     37
  As a decrepit father takes delight,
  To see his active child do deeds of youth,
  So I, made lame by Fortune's dearest spite
  Take all my comfort of thy worth and truth.
  For whether beauty, birth, or wealth, or wit,
  Or any of these all, or all, or more
  Entitled in thy parts, do crowned sit,
  I make my love engrafted to this store:
  So then I am not lame, poor, nor despised,
  Whilst that this shadow doth such substance give,
  That I in thy abundance am sufficed,
  And by a part of all thy glory live:
    Look what is best, that best I wish in thee,
    This wish I have, then ten times happy me.


                     38
  How can my muse want subject to invent
  While thou dost breathe that pour'st into my verse,
  Thine own sweet argument, too excellent,
  For every vulgar paper to rehearse?
  O give thy self the thanks if aught in me,
  Worthy perusal stand against thy sight,
  For who's so dumb that cannot write to thee,
  When thou thy self dost give invention light?
  Be thou the tenth Muse, ten times more in worth
  Than those old nine which rhymers invocate,
  And he that calls on thee, let him bring forth
  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
    If my slight muse do please these curious days,
    The pain be mine, but thine shall be the praise.


                     39
  O how thy worth with manners may I sing,
  When thou art all the better part of me?
  What can mine own praise to mine own self bring:
  And what is't but mine own when I praise thee?
  Even for this, let us divided live,
  And our dear love lose name of single one,
  That by this separation I may give:
  That due to thee which thou deserv'st alone:
  O absence what a torment wouldst thou prove,
  Were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave,
  To entertain the time with thoughts of love,
  Which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive.
    And that thou teachest how to make one twain,
    By praising him here who doth hence remain.


                     40
  Take all my loves, my love, yea take them all,
  What hast thou then more than thou hadst before?
  No love, my love, that thou mayst true love call,
  All mine was thine, before thou hadst this more:
  Then if for my love, thou my love receivest,
  I cannot blame thee, for my love thou usest,
  But yet be blamed, if thou thy self deceivest
  By wilful taste of what thy self refusest.
  I do forgive thy robbery gentle thief
  Although thou steal thee all my poverty:
  And yet love knows it is a greater grief
  To bear greater wrong, than hate's known injury.
    Lascivious grace, in whom all ill well shows,
    Kill me with spites yet we must not be foes.


                     41
  Those pretty wrongs that liberty commits,
  When I am sometime absent from thy heart,
  Thy beauty, and thy years full well befits,
  For still temptation follows where thou art.
  Gentle thou art, and therefore to be won,
  Beauteous thou art, therefore to be assailed.
  And when a woman woos, what woman's son,
  Will sourly leave her till he have prevailed?
  Ay me, but yet thou mightst my seat forbear,
  And chide thy beauty, and thy straying youth,
  Who lead thee in their riot even there
  Where thou art forced to break a twofold truth:
    Hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee,
    Thine by thy beauty being false to me.


                     42
  That thou hast her it is not all my grief,
  And yet it may be said I loved her dearly,
  That she hath thee is of my wailing chief,
  A loss in love that touches me more nearly.
  Loving offenders thus I will excuse ye,
  Thou dost love her, because thou know'st I love her,
  And for my sake even so doth she abuse me,
  Suff'ring my friend for my sake to approve her.
  If I lose thee, my loss is my love's gain,
  And losing her, my friend hath found that loss,
  Both find each other, and I lose both twain,
  And both for my sake lay on me this cross,
    But here's the joy, my friend and I are one,
    Sweet flattery, then she loves but me alone.


                     43
  When most I wink then do mine eyes best see,
  For all the day they view things unrespected,
  But when I sleep, in dreams they look on thee,
  And darkly bright, are bright in dark directed.
  Then thou whose shadow shadows doth make bright
  How would thy shadow's form, form happy show,
  To the clear day with thy much clearer light,
  When to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so!
  How would (I say) mine eyes be blessed made,
  By looking on thee in the living day,
  When in dead night thy fair imperfect shade,
  Through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay!
    All days are nights to see till I see thee,
    And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me.


                     44
  If the dull substance of my flesh were thought,
  Injurious distance should not stop my way,
  For then despite of space I would be brought,
  From limits far remote, where thou dost stay,
  No matter then although my foot did stand
  Upon the farthest earth removed from thee,
  For nimble thought can jump both sea and land,
  As soon as think the place where he would be.
  But ah, thought kills me that I am not thought
  To leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone,
  But that so much of earth and water wrought,
  I must attend, time's leisure with my moan.
    Receiving nought by elements so slow,
    But heavy tears, badges of either's woe.


                     45
  The other two, slight air, and purging fire,
  Are both with thee, wherever I abide,
  The first my thought, the other my desire,
  These present-absent with swift motion slide.
  For when these quicker elements are gone
  In tender embassy of love to thee,
  My life being made of four, with two alone,
  Sinks down to death, oppressed with melancholy.
  Until life's composition be recured,
  By those swift messengers returned from thee,
  Who even but now come back again assured,
  Of thy fair health, recounting it to me.
    This told, I joy, but then no longer glad,
    I send them back again and straight grow sad.


                     46
  Mine eye and heart are at a mortal war,
  How to divide the conquest of thy sight,
  Mine eye, my heart thy picture's sight would bar,
  My heart, mine eye the freedom of that right,
  My heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie,
  (A closet never pierced with crystal eyes)
  But the defendant doth that plea deny,
  And says in him thy fair appearance lies.
  To side this title is impanelled
  A quest of thoughts, all tenants to the heart,
  And by their verdict is determined
  The clear eye's moiety, and the dear heart's part.
    As thus, mine eye's due is thy outward part,
    And my heart's right, thy inward love of heart.


                     47
  Betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took,
  And each doth good turns now unto the other,
  When that mine eye is famished for a look,
  Or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother;
  With my love's picture then my eye doth feast,
  And to the painted banquet bids my heart:
  Another time mine eye is my heart's guest,
  And in his thoughts of love doth share a part.
  So either by thy picture or my love,
  Thy self away, art present still with me,
  For thou not farther than my thoughts canst move,
  And I am still with them, and they with thee.
    Or if they sleep, thy picture in my sight
    Awakes my heart, to heart's and eye's delight.


                     48
  How careful was I when I took my way,
  Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,
  That to my use it might unused stay
  From hands of falsehood, in sure wards of trust!
  But thou, to whom my jewels trifles are,
  Most worthy comfort, now my greatest grief,
  Thou best of dearest, and mine only care,
  Art left the prey of every vulgar thief.
  Thee have I not locked up in any chest,
  Save where thou art not, though I feel thou art,
  Within the gentle closure of my breast,
  From whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part,
    And even thence thou wilt be stol'n I fear,
    For truth proves thievish for a prize so dear.


                     49
  Against that time (if ever that time come)
  When I shall see thee frown on my defects,
  When as thy love hath cast his utmost sum,
  Called to that audit by advised respects,
  Against that time when thou shalt strangely pass,
  And scarcely greet me with that sun thine eye,
  When love converted from the thing it was
  Shall reasons find of settled gravity;
  Against that time do I ensconce me here
  Within the knowledge of mine own desert,
  And this my hand, against my self uprear,
  To guard the lawful reasons on thy part,
    To leave poor me, thou hast the strength of laws,
    Since why to love, I can allege no cause.


                     50
  How heavy do I journey on the way,
  When what I seek (my weary travel's end)
  Doth teach that case and that repose to say
  'Thus far the miles are measured from thy friend.'
  The beast that bears me, tired with my woe,
  Plods dully on, to bear that weight in me,
  As if by some instinct the wretch did know
  His rider loved not speed being made from thee:
  The bloody spur cannot provoke him on,
  That sometimes anger thrusts into his hide,
  Which heavily he answers with a groan,
  More sharp to me than spurring to his side,
    For that same groan doth put this in my mind,
    My grief lies onward and my joy behind.


                     51
  Thus can my love excuse the slow offence,
  Of my dull bearer, when from thee I speed,
  From where thou art, why should I haste me thence?
  Till I return of posting is no need.
  O what excuse will my poor beast then find,
  When swift extremity can seem but slow?
  Then should I spur though mounted on the wind,
  In winged speed no motion shall I know,
  Then can no horse with my desire keep pace,
  Therefore desire (of perfect'st love being made)
  Shall neigh (no dull flesh) in his fiery race,
  But love, for love, thus shall excuse my jade,
    Since from thee going, he went wilful-slow,
    Towards thee I'll run, and give him leave to go.


                     52
  So am I as the rich whose blessed key,
  Can bring him to his sweet up-locked treasure,
  The which he will not every hour survey,
  For blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure.
  Therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare,
  Since seldom coming in that long year set,
  Like stones of worth they thinly placed are,
  Or captain jewels in the carcanet.
  So is the time that keeps you as my chest
  Or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide,
  To make some special instant special-blest,
  By new unfolding his imprisoned pride.
    Blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope,
    Being had to triumph, being lacked to hope.


                     53
  What is your substance, whereof are you made,
  That millions of strange shadows on you tend?
  Since every one, hath every one, one shade,
  And you but one, can every shadow lend:
  Describe Adonis and the counterfeit,
  Is poorly imitated after you,
  On Helen's cheek all art of beauty set,
  And you in Grecian tires are painted new:
  Speak of the spring, and foison of the year,
  The one doth shadow of your beauty show,
  The other as your bounty doth appear,
  And you in every blessed shape we know.
    In all external grace you have some part,
    But you like none, none you for constant heart.


                     54
  O how much more doth beauty beauteous seem,
  By that sweet ornament which truth doth give!
  The rose looks fair, but fairer we it deem
  For that sweet odour, which doth in it live:
  The canker blooms have full as deep a dye,
  As the perfumed tincture of the roses,
  Hang on such thorns, and play as wantonly,
  When summer's breath their masked buds discloses:
  But for their virtue only is their show,
  They live unwooed, and unrespected fade,
  Die to themselves. Sweet roses do not so,
  Of their sweet deaths, are sweetest odours made:
    And so of you, beauteous and lovely youth,
    When that shall vade, by verse distills your truth.


                     55
  Not marble, nor the gilded monuments
  Of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme,
  But you shall shine more bright in these contents
  Than unswept stone, besmeared with sluttish time.
  When wasteful war shall statues overturn,
  And broils root out the work of masonry,
  Nor Mars his sword, nor war's quick fire shall burn:
  The living record of your memory.
  'Gainst death, and all-oblivious enmity
  Shall you pace forth, your praise shall still find room,
  Even in the eyes of all posterity
  That wear this world out to the ending doom.
    So till the judgment that your self arise,
    You live in this, and dwell in lovers' eyes.


                     56
  Sweet love renew thy force, be it not said
  Thy edge should blunter be than appetite,
  Which but to-day by feeding is allayed,
  To-morrow sharpened in his former might.
  So love be thou, although to-day thou fill
  Thy hungry eyes, even till they wink with fulness,
  To-morrow see again, and do not kill
  The spirit of love, with a perpetual dulness:
  Let this sad interim like the ocean be
  Which parts the shore, where two contracted new,
  Come daily to the banks, that when they see:
  Return of love, more blest may be the view.
    Or call it winter, which being full of care,
    Makes summer's welcome, thrice more wished, more rare.


                     57
  Being your slave what should I do but tend,
  Upon the hours, and times of your desire?
  I have no precious time at all to spend;
  Nor services to do till you require.
  Nor dare I chide the world-without-end hour,
  Whilst I (my sovereign) watch the clock for you,
  Nor think the bitterness of absence sour,
  When you have bid your servant once adieu.
  Nor dare I question with my jealous thought,
  Where you may be, or your affairs suppose,
  But like a sad slave stay and think of nought
  Save where you are, how happy you make those.
    So true a fool is love, that in your will,
    (Though you do any thing) he thinks no ill.


                     58
  That god forbid, that made me first your slave,
  I should in thought control your times of pleasure,
  Or at your hand th' account of hours to crave,
  Being your vassal bound to stay your leisure.
  O let me suffer (being at your beck)
  Th' imprisoned absence of your liberty,
  And patience tame to sufferance bide each check,
  Without accusing you of injury.
  Be where you list, your charter is so strong,
  That you your self may privilage your time
  To what you will, to you it doth belong,
  Your self to pardon of self-doing crime.
    I am to wait, though waiting so be hell,
    Not blame your pleasure be it ill or well.


                     59
  If there be nothing new, but that which is,
  Hath been before, how are our brains beguiled,
  Which labouring for invention bear amis
  The second burthen of a former child!
  O that record could with a backward look,
  Even of five hundred courses of the sun,
  Show me your image in some antique book,
  Since mind at first in character was done.
  That I might see what the old world could say,
  To this composed wonder of your frame,
  Whether we are mended, or whether better they,
  Or whether revolution be the same.
    O sure I am the wits of former days,
    To subjects worse have given admiring praise.


                     60
  Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore,
  So do our minutes hasten to their end,
  Each changing place with that which goes before,
  In sequent toil all forwards do contend.
  Nativity once in the main of light,
  Crawls to maturity, wherewith being crowned,
  Crooked eclipses 'gainst his glory fight,
  And Time that gave, doth now his gift confound.
  Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth,
  And delves the parallels in beauty's brow,
  Feeds on the rarities of nature's truth,
  And nothing stands but for his scythe to mow.
    And yet to times in hope, my verse shall stand
    Praising thy worth, despite his cruel hand.


                     61
  Is it thy will, thy image should keep open
  My heavy eyelids to the weary night?
  Dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken,
  While shadows like to thee do mock my sight?
  Is it thy spirit that thou send'st from thee
  So far from home into my deeds to pry,
  To find out shames and idle hours in me,
  The scope and tenure of thy jealousy?
  O no, thy love though much, is not so great,
  It is my love that keeps mine eye awake,
  Mine own true love that doth my rest defeat,
  To play the watchman ever for thy sake.
    For thee watch I, whilst thou dost wake elsewhere,
    From me far off, with others all too near.


                     62
  Sin of self-love possesseth all mine eye,
  And all my soul, and all my every part;
  And for this sin there is no remedy,
  It is so grounded inward in my heart.
  Methinks no face so gracious is as mine,
  No shape so true, no truth of such account,
  And for my self mine own worth do define,
  As I all other in all worths surmount.
  But when my glass shows me my self indeed
  beated and chopt with tanned antiquity,
  Mine own self-love quite contrary I read:
  Self, so self-loving were iniquity.
    'Tis thee (my self) that for my self I praise,
    Painting my age with beauty of thy days.


                     63
  Against my love shall be as I am now
  With Time's injurious hand crushed and o'erworn,
  When hours have drained his blood and filled his brow
  With lines and wrinkles, when his youthful morn
  Hath travelled on to age's steepy night,
  And all those beauties whereof now he's king
  Are vanishing, or vanished out of sight,
  Stealing away the treasure of his spring:
  For such a time do I now fortify
  Against confounding age's cruel knife,
  That he shall never cut from memory
  My sweet love's beauty, though my lover's life.
    His beauty shall in these black lines be seen,
    And they shall live, and he in them still green.


                     64
  When I have seen by Time's fell hand defaced
  The rich-proud cost of outworn buried age,
  When sometime lofty towers I see down-rased,
  And brass eternal slave to mortal rage.
  When I have seen the hungry ocean gain
  Advantage on the kingdom of the shore,
  And the firm soil win of the watery main,
  Increasing store with loss, and loss with store.
  When I have seen such interchange of State,
  Or state it self confounded, to decay,
  Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate
  That Time will come and take my love away.
    This thought is as a death which cannot choose
    But weep to have, that which it fears to lose.


                     65
  Since brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea,
  But sad mortality o'ersways their power,
  How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea,
  Whose action is no stronger than a flower?
  O how shall summer's honey breath hold out,
  Against the wrackful siege of batt'ring days,
  When rocks impregnable are not so stout,
  Nor gates of steel so strong but time decays?
  O fearful meditation, where alack,
  Shall Time's best jewel from Time's chest lie hid?
  Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back,
  Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid?
    O none, unless this miracle have might,
    That in black ink my love may still shine bright.


                     66
  Tired with all these for restful death I cry,
  As to behold desert a beggar born,
  And needy nothing trimmed in jollity,
  And purest faith unhappily forsworn,
  And gilded honour shamefully misplaced,
  And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted,
  And right perfection wrongfully disgraced,
  And strength by limping sway disabled
  And art made tongue-tied by authority,
  And folly (doctor-like) controlling skill,
  And simple truth miscalled simplicity,
  And captive good attending captain ill.
    Tired with all these, from these would I be gone,
    Save that to die, I leave my love alone.


                     67
  Ah wherefore with infection should he live,
  And with his presence grace impiety,
  That sin by him advantage should achieve,
  And lace it self with his society?
  Why should false painting imitate his cheek,
  And steal dead seeming of his living hue?
  Why should poor beauty indirectly seek,
  Roses of shadow, since his rose is true?
  Why should he live, now nature bankrupt is,
  Beggared of blood to blush through lively veins,
  For she hath no exchequer now but his,
  And proud of many, lives upon his gains?
    O him she stores, to show what wealth she had,
    In days long since, before these last so bad.


                     68
  Thus is his cheek the map of days outworn,
  When beauty lived and died as flowers do now,
  Before these bastard signs of fair were born,
  Or durst inhabit on a living brow:
  Before the golden tresses of the dead,
  The right of sepulchres, were shorn away,
  To live a second life on second head,
  Ere beauty's dead fleece made another gay:
  In him those holy antique hours are seen,
  Without all ornament, it self and true,
  Making no summer of another's green,
  Robbing no old to dress his beauty new,
    And him as for a map doth Nature store,
    To show false Art what beauty was of yore.


                     69
  Those parts of thee that the world's eye doth view,
  Want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend:
  All tongues (the voice of souls) give thee that due,
  Uttering bare truth, even so as foes commend.
  Thy outward thus with outward praise is crowned,
  But those same tongues that give thee so thine own,
  In other accents do this praise confound
  By seeing farther than the eye hath shown.
  They look into the beauty of thy mind,
  And that in guess they measure by thy deeds,
  Then churls their thoughts (although their eyes were kind)
  To thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds:
    But why thy odour matcheth not thy show,
    The soil is this, that thou dost common grow.


                     70
  That thou art blamed shall not be thy defect,
  For slander's mark was ever yet the fair,
  The ornament of beauty is suspect,
  A crow that flies in heaven's sweetest air.
  So thou be good, slander doth but approve,
  Thy worth the greater being wooed of time,
  For canker vice the sweetest buds doth love,
  And thou present'st a pure unstained prime.
  Thou hast passed by the ambush of young days,
  Either not assailed, or victor being charged,
  Yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise,
  To tie up envy, evermore enlarged,
    If some suspect of ill masked not thy show,
    Then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe.


                     71
  No longer mourn for me when I am dead,
  Than you shall hear the surly sullen bell
  Give warning to the world that I am fled
  From this vile world with vilest worms to dwell:
  Nay if you read this line, remember not,
  The hand that writ it, for I love you so,
  That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot,
  If thinking on me then should make you woe.
  O if (I say) you look upon this verse,
  When I (perhaps) compounded am with clay,
  Do not so much as my poor name rehearse;
  But let your love even with my life decay.
    Lest the wise world should look into your moan,
    And mock you with me after I am gone.


                     72
  O lest the world should task you to recite,
  What merit lived in me that you should love
  After my death (dear love) forget me quite,
  For you in me can nothing worthy prove.
  Unless you would devise some virtuous lie,
  To do more for me than mine own desert,
  And hang more praise upon deceased I,
  Than niggard truth would willingly impart:
  O lest your true love may seem false in this,
  That you for love speak well of me untrue,
  My name be buried where my body is,
  And live no more to shame nor me, nor you.
    For I am shamed by that which I bring forth,
    And so should you, to love things nothing worth.


                     73
  That time of year thou mayst in me behold,
  When yellow leaves, or none, or few do hang
  Upon those boughs which shake against the cold,
  Bare ruined choirs, where late the sweet birds sang.
  In me thou seest the twilight of such day,
  As after sunset fadeth in the west,
  Which by and by black night doth take away,
  Death's second self that seals up all in rest.
  In me thou seest the glowing of such fire,
  That on the ashes of his youth doth lie,
  As the death-bed, whereon it must expire,
  Consumed with that which it was nourished by.
    This thou perceiv'st, which makes thy love more strong,
    To love that well, which thou must leave ere long.


                     74
  But be contented when that fell arrest,
  Without all bail shall carry me away,
  My life hath in this line some interest,
  Which for memorial still with thee shall stay.
  When thou reviewest this, thou dost review,
  The very part was consecrate to thee,
  The earth can have but earth, which is his due,
  My spirit is thine the better part of me,
  So then thou hast but lost the dregs of life,
  The prey of worms, my body being dead,
  The coward conquest of a wretch's knife,
  Too base of thee to be remembered,
    The worth of that, is that which it contains,
    And that is this, and this with thee remains.


                     75
  So are you to my thoughts as food to life,
  Or as sweet-seasoned showers are to the ground;
  And for the peace of you I hold such strife
  As 'twixt a miser and his wealth is found.
  Now proud as an enjoyer, and anon
  Doubting the filching age will steal his treasure,
  Now counting best to be with you alone,
  Then bettered that the world may see my pleasure,
  Sometime all full with feasting on your sight,
  And by and by clean starved for a look,
  Possessing or pursuing no delight
  Save what is had, or must from you be took.
    Thus do I pine and surfeit day by day,
    Or gluttoning on all, or all away.


                     76
  Why is my verse so barren of new pride?
  So far from variation or quick change?
  Why with the time do I not glance aside
  To new-found methods, and to compounds strange?
  Why write I still all one, ever the same,
  And keep invention in a noted weed,
  That every word doth almost tell my name,
  Showing their birth, and where they did proceed?
  O know sweet love I always write of you,
  And you and love are still my argument:
  So all my best is dressing old words new,
  Spending again what is already spent:
    For as the sun is daily new and old,
    So is my love still telling what is told.


                     77
  Thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear,
  Thy dial how thy precious minutes waste,
  These vacant leaves thy mind's imprint will bear,
  And of this book, this learning mayst thou taste.
  The wrinkles which thy glass will truly show,
  Of mouthed graves will give thee memory,
  Thou by thy dial's shady stealth mayst know,
  Time's thievish progress to eternity.
  Look what thy memory cannot contain,
  Commit to these waste blanks, and thou shalt find
  Those children nursed, delivered from thy brain,
  To take a new acquaintance of thy mind.
    These offices, so oft as thou wilt look,
    Shall profit thee, and much enrich thy book.


                     78
  So oft have I invoked thee for my muse,
  And found such fair assistance in my verse,
  As every alien pen hath got my use,
  And under thee their poesy disperse.
  Thine eyes, that taught the dumb on high to sing,
  And heavy ignorance aloft to fly,
  Have added feathers to the learned's wing,
  And given grace a double majesty.
  Yet be most proud of that which I compile,
  Whose influence is thine, and born of thee,
  In others' works thou dost but mend the style,
  And arts with thy sweet graces graced be.
    But thou art all my art, and dost advance
    As high as learning, my rude ignorance.


                     79
  Whilst I alone did call upon thy aid,
  My verse alone had all thy gentle grace,
  But now my gracious numbers are decayed,
  And my sick muse doth give an other place.
  I grant (sweet love) thy lovely argument
  Deserves the travail of a worthier pen,
  Yet what of thee thy poet doth invent,
  He robs thee of, and pays it thee again,
  He lends thee virtue, and he stole that word,
  From thy behaviour, beauty doth he give
  And found it in thy cheek: he can afford
  No praise to thee, but what in thee doth live.
    Then thank him not for that which he doth say,
    Since what he owes thee, thou thy self dost pay.


                     80
  O how I faint when I of you do write,
  Knowing a better spirit doth use your name,
  And in the praise thereof spends all his might,
  To make me tongue-tied speaking of your fame.
  But since your worth (wide as the ocean is)
  The humble as the proudest sail doth bear,
  My saucy bark (inferior far to his)
  On your broad main doth wilfully appear.
  Your shallowest help will hold me up afloat,
  Whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride,
  Or (being wrecked) I am a worthless boat,
  He of tall building, and of goodly pride.
    Then if he thrive and I be cast away,
    The worst was this, my love was my decay.


                     81
  Or I shall live your epitaph to make,
  Or you survive when I in earth am rotten,
  From hence your memory death cannot take,
  Although in me each part will be forgotten.
  Your name from hence immortal life shall have,
  Though I (once gone) to all the world must die,
  The earth can yield me but a common grave,
  When you entombed in men's eyes shall lie,
  Your monument shall be my gentle verse,
  Which eyes not yet created shall o'er-read,
  And tongues to be, your being shall rehearse,
  When all the breathers of this world are dead,
    You still shall live (such virtue hath my pen)
    Where breath most breathes, even in the mouths of men.


                     82
  I grant thou wert not married to my muse,
  And therefore mayst without attaint o'erlook
  The dedicated words which writers use
  Of their fair subject, blessing every book.
  Thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue,
  Finding thy worth a limit past my praise,
  And therefore art enforced to seek anew,
  Some fresher stamp of the time-bettering days.
  And do so love, yet when they have devised,
  What strained touches rhetoric can lend,
  Thou truly fair, wert truly sympathized,
  In true plain words, by thy true-telling friend.
    And their gross painting might be better used,
    Where cheeks need blood, in thee it is abused.


                     83
  I never saw that you did painting need,
  And therefore to your fair no painting set,
  I found (or thought I found) you did exceed,
  That barren tender of a poet's debt:
  And therefore have I slept in your report,
  That you your self being extant well might show,
  How far a modern quill doth come too short,
  Speaking of worth, what worth in you doth grow.
  This silence for my sin you did impute,
  Which shall be most my glory being dumb,
  For I impair not beauty being mute,
  When others would give life, and bring a tomb.
    There lives more life in one of your fair eyes,
    Than both your poets can in praise devise.


                     84
  Who is it that says most, which can say more,
  Than this rich praise, that you alone, are you?
  In whose confine immured is the store,
  Which should example where your equal grew.
  Lean penury within that pen doth dwell,
  That to his subject lends not some small glory,
  But he that writes of you, if he can tell,
  That you are you, so dignifies his story.
  Let him but copy what in you is writ,
  Not making worse what nature made so clear,
  And such a counterpart shall fame his wit,
  Making his style admired every where.
    You to your beauteous blessings add a curse,
    Being fond on praise, which makes your praises worse.


                     85
  My tongue-tied muse in manners holds her still,
  While comments of your praise richly compiled,
  Reserve their character with golden quill,
  And precious phrase by all the Muses filed.
  I think good thoughts, whilst other write good words,
  And like unlettered clerk still cry Amen,
  To every hymn that able spirit affords,
  In polished form of well refined pen.
  Hearing you praised, I say 'tis so, 'tis true,
  And to the most of praise add something more,
  But that is in my thought, whose love to you
  (Though words come hindmost) holds his rank before,
    Then others, for the breath of words respect,
    Me for my dumb thoughts, speaking in effect.


                     86
  Was it the proud full sail of his great verse,
  Bound for the prize of (all too precious) you,
  That did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse,
  Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew?
  Was it his spirit, by spirits taught to write,
  Above a mortal pitch, that struck me dead?
  No, neither he, nor his compeers by night
  Giving him aid, my verse astonished.
  He nor that affable familiar ghost
  Which nightly gulls him with intelligence,
  As victors of my silence cannot boast,
  I was not sick of any fear from thence.
    But when your countenance filled up his line,
    Then lacked I matter, that enfeebled mine.


                     87
  Farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing,
  And like enough thou know'st thy estimate,
  The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing:
  My bonds in thee are all determinate.
  For how do I hold thee but by thy granting,
  And for that riches where is my deserving?
  The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting,
  And so my patent back again is swerving.
  Thy self thou gav'st, thy own worth then not knowing,
  Or me to whom thou gav'st it, else mistaking,
  So thy great gift upon misprision growing,
  Comes home again, on better judgement making.
    Thus have I had thee as a dream doth flatter,
    In sleep a king, but waking no such matter.


                     88
  When thou shalt be disposed to set me light,
  And place my merit in the eye of scorn,
  Upon thy side, against my self I'll fight,
  And prove thee virtuous, though thou art forsworn:
  With mine own weakness being best acquainted,
  Upon thy part I can set down a story
  Of faults concealed, wherein I am attainted:
  That thou in losing me, shalt win much glory:
  And I by this will be a gainer too,
  For bending all my loving thoughts on thee,
  The injuries that to my self I do,
  Doing thee vantage, double-vantage me.
    Such is my love, to thee I so belong,
    That for thy right, my self will bear all wrong.


                     89
  Say that thou didst forsake me for some fault,
  And I will comment upon that offence,
  Speak of my lameness, and I straight will halt:
  Against thy reasons making no defence.
  Thou canst not (love) disgrace me half so ill,
  To set a form upon desired change,
  As I'll my self disgrace, knowing thy will,
  I will acquaintance strangle and look strange:
  Be absent from thy walks and in my tongue,
  Thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell,
  Lest I (too much profane) should do it wronk:
  And haply of our old acquaintance tell.
    For thee, against my self I'll vow debate,
    For I must ne'er love him whom thou dost hate.


                     90
  Then hate me when thou wilt, if ever, now,
  Now while the world is bent my deeds to cross,
  join with the spite of fortune, make me bow,
  And do not drop in for an after-loss:
  Ah do not, when my heart hath 'scaped this sorrow,
  Come in the rearward of a conquered woe,
  Give not a windy night a rainy morrow,
  To linger out a purposed overthrow.
  If thou wilt leave me, do not leave me last,
  When other petty griefs have done their spite,
  But in the onset come, so shall I taste
  At first the very worst of fortune's might.
    And other strains of woe, which now seem woe,
    Compared with loss of thee, will not seem so.


                     91
  Some glory in their birth, some in their skill,
  Some in their wealth, some in their body's force,
  Some in their garments though new-fangled ill:
  Some in their hawks and hounds, some in their horse.
  And every humour hath his adjunct pleasure,
  Wherein it finds a joy above the rest,
  But these particulars are not my measure,
  All these I better in one general best.
  Thy love is better than high birth to me,
  Richer than wealth, prouder than garments' costs,
  Of more delight than hawks and horses be:
  And having thee, of all men's pride I boast.
    Wretched in this alone, that thou mayst take,
    All this away, and me most wretchcd make.


                     92
  But do thy worst to steal thy self away,
  For term of life thou art assured mine,
  And life no longer than thy love will stay,
  For it depends upon that love of thine.
  Then need I not to fear the worst of wrongs,
  When in the least of them my life hath end,
  I see, a better state to me belongs
  Than that, which on thy humour doth depend.
  Thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind,
  Since that my life on thy revolt doth lie,
  O what a happy title do I find,
  Happy to have thy love, happy to die!
    But what's so blessed-fair that fears no blot?
    Thou mayst be false, and yet I know it not.


                     93
  So shall I live, supposing thou art true,
  Like a deceived husband, so love's face,
  May still seem love to me, though altered new:
  Thy looks with me, thy heart in other place.
  For there can live no hatred in thine eye,
  Therefore in that I cannot know thy change,
  In many's looks, the false heart's history
  Is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange.
  But heaven in thy creation did decree,
  That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell,
  Whate'er thy thoughts, or thy heart's workings be,
  Thy looks should nothing thence, but sweetness tell.
    How like Eve's apple doth thy beauty grow,
    If thy sweet virtue answer not thy show.


                     94
  They that have power to hurt, and will do none,
  That do not do the thing, they most do show,
  Who moving others, are themselves as stone,
  Unmoved, cold, and to temptation slow:
  They rightly do inherit heaven's graces,
  And husband nature's riches from expense,
  Tibey are the lords and owners of their faces,
  Others, but stewards of their excellence:
  The summer's flower is to the summer sweet,
  Though to it self, it only live and die,
  But if that flower with base infection meet,
  The basest weed outbraves his dignity:
    For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds,
    Lilies that fester, smell far worse than weeds.


                     95
  How sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame,
  Which like a canker in the fragrant rose,
  Doth spot the beauty of thy budding name!
  O in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose!
  That tongue that tells the story of thy days,
  (Making lascivious comments on thy sport)
  Cannot dispraise, but in a kind of praise,
  Naming thy name, blesses an ill report.
  O what a mansion have those vices got,
  Which for their habitation chose out thee,
  Where beauty's veil doth cover every blot,
  And all things turns to fair, that eyes can see!
    Take heed (dear heart) of this large privilege,
    The hardest knife ill-used doth lose his edge.


                     96
  Some say thy fault is youth, some wantonness,
  Some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport,
  Both grace and faults are loved of more and less:
  Thou mak'st faults graces, that to thee resort:
  As on the finger of a throned queen,
  The basest jewel will be well esteemed:
  So are those errors that in thee are seen,
  To truths translated, and for true things deemed.
  How many lambs might the stern wolf betray,
  If like a lamb he could his looks translate!
  How many gazers mightst thou lead away,
  if thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state!
    But do not so, I love thee in such sort,
    As thou being mine, mine is thy good report.


                     97
  How like a winter hath my absence been
  From thee, the pleasure of the fleeting year!
  What freezings have I felt, what dark days seen!
  What old December's bareness everywhere!
  And yet this time removed was summer's time,
  The teeming autumn big with rich increase,
  Bearing the wanton burden of the prime,
  Like widowed wombs after their lords' decease:
  Yet this abundant issue seemed to me
  But hope of orphans, and unfathered fruit,
  For summer and his pleasures wait on thee,
  And thou away, the very birds are mute.
    Or if they sing, 'tis with so dull a cheer,
    That leaves look pale, dreading the winter's near.


                     98
  From you have I been absent in the spring,
  When proud-pied April (dressed in all his trim)
  Hath put a spirit of youth in every thing:
  That heavy Saturn laughed and leaped with him.
  Yet nor the lays of birds, nor the sweet smell
  Of different flowers in odour and in hue,
  Could make me any summer's story tell:
  Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew:
  Nor did I wonder at the lily's white,
  Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose,
  They were but sweet, but figures of delight:
  Drawn after you, you pattern of all those.
    Yet seemed it winter still, and you away,
    As with your shadow I with these did play.


                     99
  The forward violet thus did I chide,
  Sweet thief, whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells,
  If not from my love's breath? The purple pride
  Which on thy soft check for complexion dwells,
  In my love's veins thou hast too grossly dyed.
  The lily I condemned for thy hand,
  And buds of marjoram had stol'n thy hair,
  The roses fearfully on thorns did stand,
  One blushing shame, another white despair:
  A third nor red, nor white, had stol'n of both,
  And to his robbery had annexed thy breath,
  But for his theft in pride of all his growth
  A vengeful canker eat him up to death.
    More flowers I noted, yet I none could see,
    But sweet, or colour it had stol'n from thee.


                     100
  Where art thou Muse that thou forget'st so long,
  To speak of that which gives thee all thy might?
  Spend'st thou thy fury on some worthless song,
  Darkening thy power to lend base subjects light?
  Return forgetful Muse, and straight redeem,
  In gentle numbers time so idly spent,
  Sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem,
  And gives thy pen both skill and argument.
  Rise resty Muse, my love's sweet face survey,
  If time have any wrinkle graven there,
  If any, be a satire to decay,
  And make time's spoils despised everywhere.
    Give my love fame faster than Time wastes life,
    So thou prevent'st his scythe, and crooked knife.


                     101
  O truant Muse what shall be thy amends,
  For thy neglect of truth in beauty dyed?
  Both truth and beauty on my love depends:
  So dost thou too, and therein dignified:
  Make answer Muse, wilt thou not haply say,
  'Truth needs no colour with his colour fixed,
  Beauty no pencil, beauty's truth to lay:
  But best is best, if never intermixed'?
  Because he needs no praise, wilt thou be dumb?
  Excuse not silence so, for't lies in thee,
  To make him much outlive a gilded tomb:
  And to be praised of ages yet to be.
    Then do thy office Muse, I teach thee how,
    To make him seem long hence, as he shows now.


                     102
  My love is strengthened though more weak in seeming,
  I love not less, though less the show appear,
  That love is merchandized, whose rich esteeming,
  The owner's tongue doth publish every where.
  Our love was new, and then but in the spring,
  When I was wont to greet it with my lays,
  As Philomel in summer's front doth sing,
  And stops her pipe in growth of riper days:
  Not that the summer is less pleasant now
  Than when her mournful hymns did hush the night,
  But that wild music burthens every bough,
  And sweets grown common lose their dear delight.
    Therefore like her, I sometime hold my tongue:
    Because I would not dull you with my song.


                     103
  Alack what poverty my muse brings forth,
  That having such a scope to show her pride,
  The argument all bare is of more worth
  Than when it hath my added praise beside.
  O blame me not if I no more can write!
  Look in your glass and there appears a face,
  That over-goes my blunt invention quite,
  Dulling my lines, and doing me disgrace.
  Were it not sinful then striving to mend,
  To mar the subject that before was well?
  For to no other pass my verses tend,
  Than of your graces and your gifts to tell.
    And more, much more than in my verse can sit,
    Your own glass shows you, when you look in it.


                     104
  To me fair friend you never can be old,
  For as you were when first your eye I eyed,
  Such seems your beauty still: three winters cold,
  Have from the forests shook three summers' pride,
  Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turned,
  In process of the seasons have I seen,
  Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burned,
  Since first I saw you fresh which yet are green.
  Ah yet doth beauty like a dial hand,
  Steal from his figure, and no pace perceived,
  So your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand
  Hath motion, and mine eye may be deceived.
    For fear of which, hear this thou age unbred,
    Ere you were born was beauty's summer dead.


                     105
  Let not my love be called idolatry,
  Nor my beloved as an idol show,
  Since all alike my songs and praises be
  To one, of one, still such, and ever so.
  Kind is my love to-day, to-morrow kind,
  Still constant in a wondrous excellence,
  Therefore my verse to constancy confined,
  One thing expressing, leaves out difference.
  Fair, kind, and true, is all my argument,
  Fair, kind, and true, varying to other words,
  And in this change is my invention spent,
  Three themes in one, which wondrous scope affords.
    Fair, kind, and true, have often lived alone.
    Which three till now, never kept seat in one.


                     106
  When in the chronicle of wasted time,
  I see descriptions of the fairest wights,
  And beauty making beautiful old rhyme,
  In praise of ladies dead, and lovely knights,
  Then in the blazon of sweet beauty's best,
  Of hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow,
  I see their antique pen would have expressed,
  Even such a beauty as you master now.
  So all their praises are but prophecies
  Of this our time, all you prefiguring,
  And for they looked but with divining eyes,
  They had not skill enough your worth to sing:
    For we which now behold these present days,
    Have eyes to wonder, but lack tongues to praise.


                     107
  Not mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul,
  Of the wide world, dreaming on things to come,
  Can yet the lease of my true love control,
  Supposed as forfeit to a confined doom.
  The mortal moon hath her eclipse endured,
  And the sad augurs mock their own presage,
  Incertainties now crown themselves assured,
  And peace proclaims olives of endless age.
  Now with the drops of this most balmy time,
  My love looks fresh, and death to me subscribes,
  Since spite of him I'll live in this poor rhyme,
  While he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes.
    And thou in this shalt find thy monument,
    When tyrants' crests and tombs of brass are spent.


                     108
  What's in the brain that ink may character,
  Which hath not figured to thee my true spirit,
  What's new to speak, what now to register,
  That may express my love, or thy dear merit?
  Nothing sweet boy, but yet like prayers divine,
  I must each day say o'er the very same,
  Counting no old thing old, thou mine, I thine,
  Even as when first I hallowed thy fair name.
  So that eternal love in love's fresh case,
  Weighs not the dust and injury of age,
  Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place,
  But makes antiquity for aye his page,
    Finding the first conceit of love there bred,
    Where time and outward form would show it dead.


                     109
  O never say that I was false of heart,
  Though absence seemed my flame to qualify,
  As easy might I from my self depart,
  As from my soul which in thy breast doth lie:
  That is my home of love, if I have ranged,
  Like him that travels I return again,
  Just to the time, not with the time exchanged,
  So that my self bring water for my stain,
  Never believe though in my nature reigned,
  All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood,
  That it could so preposterously be stained,
  To leave for nothing all thy sum of good:
    For nothing this wide universe I call,
    Save thou my rose, in it thou art my all.


                     110
  Alas 'tis true, I have gone here and there,
  And made my self a motley to the view,
  Gored mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear,
  Made old offences of affections new.
  Most true it is, that I have looked on truth
  Askance and strangely: but by all above,
  These blenches gave my heart another youth,
  And worse essays proved thee my best of love.
  Now all is done, have what shall have no end,
  Mine appetite I never more will grind
  On newer proof, to try an older friend,
  A god in love, to whom I am confined.
    Then give me welcome, next my heaven the best,
    Even to thy pure and most most loving breast.


                     111
  O for my sake do you with Fortune chide,
  The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds,
  That did not better for my life provide,
  Than public means which public manners breeds.
  Thence comes it that my name receives a brand,
  And almost thence my nature is subdued
  To what it works in, like the dyer's hand:
  Pity me then, and wish I were renewed,
  Whilst like a willing patient I will drink,
  Potions of eisel 'gainst my strong infection,
  No bitterness that I will bitter think,
  Nor double penance to correct correction.
    Pity me then dear friend, and I assure ye,
    Even that your pity is enough to cure me.


                     112
  Your love and pity doth th' impression fill,
  Which vulgar scandal stamped upon my brow,
  For what care I who calls me well or ill,
  So you o'er-green my bad, my good allow?
  You are my all the world, and I must strive,
  To know my shames and praises from your tongue,
  None else to me, nor I to none alive,
  That my steeled sense or changes right or wrong.
  In so profound abysm I throw all care
  Of others' voices, that my adder's sense,
  To critic and to flatterer stopped are:
  Mark how with my neglect I do dispense.
    You are so strongly in my purpose bred,
    That all the world besides methinks are dead.


                     113
  Since I left you, mine eye is in my mind,
  And that which governs me to go about,
  Doth part his function, and is partly blind,
  Seems seeing, but effectually is out:
  For it no form delivers to the heart
  Of bird, of flower, or shape which it doth latch,
  Of his quick objects hath the mind no part,
  Nor his own vision holds what it doth catch:
  For if it see the rud'st or gentlest sight,
  The most sweet favour or deformed'st creature,
  The mountain, or the sea, the day, or night:
  The crow, or dove, it shapes them to your feature.
    Incapable of more, replete with you,
    My most true mind thus maketh mine untrue.


                     114
  Or whether doth my mind being crowned with you
  Drink up the monarch's plague this flattery?
  Or whether shall I say mine eye saith true,
  And that your love taught it this alchemy?
  To make of monsters, and things indigest,
  Such cherubins as your sweet self resemble,
  Creating every bad a perfect best
  As fast as objects to his beams assemble:
  O 'tis the first, 'tis flattery in my seeing,
  And my great mind most kingly drinks it up,
  Mine eye well knows what with his gust is 'greeing,
  And to his palate doth prepare the cup.
    If it be poisoned, 'tis the lesser sin,
    That mine eye loves it and doth first begin.


                     115
  Those lines that I before have writ do lie,
  Even those that said I could not love you dearer,
  Yet then my judgment knew no reason why,
  My most full flame should afterwards burn clearer,
  But reckoning time, whose millioned accidents
  Creep in 'twixt vows, and change decrees of kings,
  Tan sacred beauty, blunt the sharp'st intents,
  Divert strong minds to the course of alt'ring things:
  Alas why fearing of time's tyranny,
  Might I not then say 'Now I love you best,'
  When I was certain o'er incertainty,
  Crowning the present, doubting of the rest?
    Love is a babe, then might I not say so
    To give full growth to that which still doth grow.


                     116
  Let me not to the marriage of true minds
  Admit impediments, love is not love
  Which alters when it alteration finds,
  Or bends with the remover to remove.
  O no, it is an ever-fixed mark
  That looks on tempests and is never shaken;
  It is the star to every wand'ring bark,
  Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.
  Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks
  Within his bending sickle's compass come,
  Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,
  But bears it out even to the edge of doom:
    If this be error and upon me proved,
    I never writ, nor no man ever loved.


                     117
  Accuse me thus, that I have scanted all,
  Wherein I should your great deserts repay,
  Forgot upon your dearest love to call,
  Whereto all bonds do tie me day by day,
  That I have frequent been with unknown minds,
  And given to time your own dear-purchased right,
  That I have hoisted sail to all the winds
  Which should transport me farthest from your sight.
  Book both my wilfulness and errors down,
  And on just proof surmise, accumulate,
  Bring me within the level of your frown,
  But shoot not at me in your wakened hate:
    Since my appeal says I did strive to prove
    The constancy and virtue of your love.


                     118
  Like as to make our appetite more keen
  With eager compounds we our palate urge,
  As to prevent our maladies unseen,
  We sicken to shun sickness when we purge.
  Even so being full of your ne'er-cloying sweetness,
  To bitter sauces did I frame my feeding;
  And sick of welfare found a kind of meetness,
  To be diseased ere that there was true needing.
  Thus policy in love t' anticipate
  The ills that were not, grew to faults assured,
  And brought to medicine a healthful state
  Which rank of goodness would by ill be cured.
    But thence I learn and find the lesson true,
    Drugs poison him that so feil sick of you.


                     119
  What potions have I drunk of Siren tears
  Distilled from limbecks foul as hell within,
  Applying fears to hopes, and hopes to fears,
  Still losing when I saw my self to win!
  What wretched errors hath my heart committed,
  Whilst it hath thought it self so blessed never!
  How have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted
  In the distraction of this madding fever!
  O benefit of ill, now I find true
  That better is, by evil still made better.
  And ruined love when it is built anew
  Grows fairer than at first, more strong, far greater.
    So I return rebuked to my content,
    And gain by ills thrice more than I have spent.


                     120
  That you were once unkind befriends me now,
  And for that sorrow, which I then did feel,
  Needs must I under my transgression bow,
  Unless my nerves were brass or hammered steel.
  For if you were by my unkindness shaken
  As I by yours, y'have passed a hell of time,
  And I a tyrant have no leisure taken
  To weigh how once I suffered in your crime.
  O that our night of woe might have remembered
  My deepest sense, how hard true sorrow hits,
  And soon to you, as you to me then tendered
  The humble salve, which wounded bosoms fits!
    But that your trespass now becomes a fee,
    Mine ransoms yours, and yours must ransom me.


                     121
  'Tis better to be vile than vile esteemed,
  When not to be, receives reproach of being,
  And the just pleasure lost, which is so deemed,
  Not by our feeling, but by others' seeing.
  For why should others' false adulterate eyes
  Give salutation to my sportive blood?
  Or on my frailties why are frailer spies,
  Which in their wills count bad what I think good?
  No, I am that I am, and they that level
  At my abuses, reckon up their own,
  I may be straight though they themselves be bevel;
  By their rank thoughts, my deeds must not be shown
    Unless this general evil they maintain,
    All men are bad and in their badness reign.


                     122
  Thy gift, thy tables, are within my brain
  Full charactered with lasting memory,
  Which shall above that idle rank remain
  Beyond all date even to eternity.
  Or at the least, so long as brain and heart
  Have faculty by nature to subsist,
  Till each to razed oblivion yield his part
  Of thee, thy record never can be missed:
  That poor retention could not so much hold,
  Nor need I tallies thy dear love to score,
  Therefore to give them from me was I bold,
  To trust those tables that receive thee more:
    To keep an adjunct to remember thee
    Were to import forgetfulness in me.


                     123
  No! Time, thou shalt not boast that I do change,
  Thy pyramids built up with newer might
  To me are nothing novel, nothing strange,
  They are but dressings Of a former sight:
  Our dates are brief, and therefore we admire,
  What thou dost foist upon us that is old,
  And rather make them born to our desire,
  Than think that we before have heard them told:
  Thy registers and thee I both defy,
  Not wond'ring at the present, nor the past,
  For thy records, and what we see doth lie,
  Made more or less by thy continual haste:
    This I do vow and this shall ever be,
    I will be true despite thy scythe and thee.


                     124
  If my dear love were but the child of state,
  It might for Fortune's bastard be unfathered,
  As subject to time's love or to time's hate,
  Weeds among weeds, or flowers with flowers gathered.
  No it was builded far from accident,
  It suffers not in smiling pomp, nor falls
  Under the blow of thralled discontent,
  Whereto th' inviting time our fashion calls:
  It fears not policy that heretic,
  Which works on leases of short-numbered hours,
  But all alone stands hugely politic,
  That it nor grows with heat, nor drowns with showers.
    To this I witness call the fools of time,
    Which die for goodness, who have lived for crime.


                     125
  Were't aught to me I bore the canopy,
  With my extern the outward honouring,
  Or laid great bases for eternity,
  Which proves more short than waste or ruining?
  Have I not seen dwellers on form and favour
  Lose all, and more by paying too much rent
  For compound sweet; forgoing simple savour,
  Pitiful thrivers in their gazing spent?
  No, let me be obsequious in thy heart,
  And take thou my oblation, poor but free,
  Which is not mixed with seconds, knows no art,
  But mutual render, only me for thee.
    Hence, thou suborned informer, a true soul
    When most impeached, stands least in thy control.


                     126
  O thou my lovely boy who in thy power,
  Dost hold Time's fickle glass his fickle hour:
  Who hast by waning grown, and therein show'st,
  Thy lovers withering, as thy sweet self grow'st.
  If Nature (sovereign mistress over wrack)
  As thou goest onwards still will pluck thee back,
  She keeps thee to this purpose, that her skill
  May time disgrace, and wretched minutes kill.
  Yet fear her O thou minion of her pleasure,
  She may detain, but not still keep her treasure!
    Her audit (though delayed) answered must be,
    And her quietus is to render thee.


                     127
  In the old age black was not counted fair,
  Or if it were it bore not beauty's name:
  But now is black beauty's successive heir,
  And beauty slandered with a bastard shame,
  For since each hand hath put on nature's power,
  Fairing the foul with art's false borrowed face,
  Sweet beauty hath no name no holy bower,
  But is profaned, if not lives in disgrace.
  Therefore my mistress' eyes are raven black,
  Her eyes so suited, and they mourners seem,
  At such who not born fair no beauty lack,
  Slandering creation with a false esteem,
    Yet so they mourn becoming of their woe,
    That every tongue says beauty should look so.


                     128
  How oft when thou, my music, music play'st,
  Upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds
  With thy sweet fingers when thou gently sway'st
  The wiry concord that mine ear confounds,
  Do I envy those jacks that nimble leap,
  To kiss the tender inward of thy hand,
  Whilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap,
  At the wood's boldness by thee blushing stand.
  To be so tickled they would change their state
  And situation with those dancing chips,
  O'er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait,
  Making dead wood more blest than living lips,
    Since saucy jacks so happy are in this,
    Give them thy fingers, me thy lips to kiss.


                     129
  Th' expense of spirit in a waste of shame
  Is lust in action, and till action, lust
  Is perjured, murd'rous, bloody full of blame,
  Savage, extreme, rude, cruel, not to trust,
  Enjoyed no sooner but despised straight,
  Past reason hunted, and no sooner had
  Past reason hated as a swallowed bait,
  On purpose laid to make the taker mad.
  Mad in pursuit and in possession so,
  Had, having, and in quest, to have extreme,
  A bliss in proof and proved, a very woe,
  Before a joy proposed behind a dream.
    All this the world well knows yet none knows well,
    To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell.


                     130
  My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun,
  Coral is far more red, than her lips red,
  If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun:
  If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head:
  I have seen roses damasked, red and white,
  But no such roses see I in her cheeks,
  And in some perfumes is there more delight,
  Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.
  I love to hear her speak, yet well I know,
  That music hath a far more pleasing sound:
  I grant I never saw a goddess go,
  My mistress when she walks treads on the ground.
    And yet by heaven I think my love as rare,
    As any she belied with false compare.


                     131
  Thou art as tyrannous, so as thou art,
  As those whose beauties proudly make them cruel;
  For well thou know'st to my dear doting heart
  Thou art the fairest and most precious jewel.
  Yet in good faith some say that thee behold,
  Thy face hath not the power to make love groan;
  To say they err, I dare not be so bold,
  Although I swear it to my self alone.
  And to be sure that is not false I swear,
  A thousand groans but thinking on thy face,
  One on another's neck do witness bear
  Thy black is fairest in my judgment's place.
    In nothing art thou black save in thy deeds,
    And thence this slander as I think proceeds.


                     132
  Thine eyes I love, and they as pitying me,
  Knowing thy heart torment me with disdain,
  Have put on black, and loving mourners be,
  Looking with pretty ruth upon my pain.
  And truly not the morning sun of heaven
  Better becomes the grey cheeks of the east,
  Nor that full star that ushers in the even
  Doth half that glory to the sober west
  As those two mourning eyes become thy face:
  O let it then as well beseem thy heart
  To mourn for me since mourning doth thee grace,
  And suit thy pity like in every part.
    Then will I swear beauty herself is black,
    And all they foul that thy complexion lack.


                     133
  Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan
  For that deep wound it gives my friend and me;
  Is't not enough to torture me alone,
  But slave to slavery my sweet'st friend must be?
  Me from my self thy cruel eye hath taken,
  And my next self thou harder hast engrossed,
  Of him, my self, and thee I am forsaken,
  A torment thrice three-fold thus to be crossed:
  Prison my heart in thy steel bosom's ward,
  But then my friend's heart let my poor heart bail,
  Whoe'er keeps me, let my heart be his guard,
  Thou canst not then use rigour in my gaol.
    And yet thou wilt, for I being pent in thee,
    Perforce am thine and all that is in me.


                     134
  So now I have confessed that he is thine,
  And I my self am mortgaged to thy will,
  My self I'll forfeit, so that other mine,
  Thou wilt restore to be my comfort still:
  But thou wilt not, nor he will not be free,
  For thou art covetous, and he is kind,
  He learned but surety-like to write for me,
  Under that bond that him as fist doth bind.
  The statute of thy beauty thou wilt take,
  Thou usurer that put'st forth all to use,
  And sue a friend, came debtor for my sake,
  So him I lose through my unkind abuse.
    Him have I lost, thou hast both him and me,
    He pays the whole, and yet am I not free.


                     135
  Whoever hath her wish, thou hast thy will,
  And 'Will' to boot, and 'Will' in over-plus,
  More than enough am I that vex thee still,
  To thy sweet will making addition thus.
  Wilt thou whose will is large and spacious,
  Not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine?
  Shall will in others seem right gracious,
  And in my will no fair acceptance shine?
  The sea all water, yet receives rain still,
  And in abundance addeth to his store,
  So thou being rich in will add to thy will
  One will of mine to make thy large will more.
    Let no unkind, no fair beseechers kill,
    Think all but one, and me in that one 'Will.'


                     136
  If thy soul check thee that I come so near,
  Swear to thy blind soul that I was thy 'Will',
  And will thy soul knows is admitted there,
  Thus far for love, my love-suit sweet fulfil.
  'Will', will fulfil the treasure of thy love,
  Ay, fill it full with wills, and my will one,
  In things of great receipt with case we prove,
  Among a number one is reckoned none.
  Then in the number let me pass untold,
  Though in thy store's account I one must be,
  For nothing hold me, so it please thee hold,
  That nothing me, a something sweet to thee.
    Make but my name thy love, and love that still,
    And then thou lov'st me for my name is Will.


                     137
  Thou blind fool Love, what dost thou to mine eyes,
  That they behold and see not what they see?
  They know what beauty is, see where it lies,
  Yet what the best is, take the worst to be.
  If eyes corrupt by over-partial looks,
  Be anchored in the bay where all men ride,
  Why of eyes' falsehood hast thou forged hooks,
  Whereto the judgment of my heart is tied?
  Why should my heart think that a several plot,
  Which my heart knows the wide world's common place?
  Or mine eyes seeing this, say this is not
  To put fair truth upon so foul a face?
    In things right true my heart and eyes have erred,
    And to this false plague are they now transferred.


                     138
  When my love swears that she is made of truth,
  I do believe her though I know she lies,
  That she might think me some untutored youth,
  Unlearned in the world's false subtleties.
  Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young,
  Although she knows my days are past the best,
  Simply I credit her false-speaking tongue,
  On both sides thus is simple truth suppressed:
  But wherefore says she not she is unjust?
  And wherefore say not I that I am old?
  O love's best habit is in seeming trust,
  And age in love, loves not to have years told.
    Therefore I lie with her, and she with me,
    And in our faults by lies we flattered be.


                     139
  O call not me to justify the wrong,
  That thy unkindness lays upon my heart,
  Wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue,
  Use power with power, and slay me not by art,
  Tell me thou lov'st elsewhere; but in my sight,
  Dear heart forbear to glance thine eye aside,
  What need'st thou wound with cunning when thy might
  Is more than my o'erpressed defence can bide?
  Let me excuse thee, ah my love well knows,
  Her pretty looks have been mine enemies,
  And therefore from my face she turns my foes,
  That they elsewhere might dart their injuries:
    Yet do not so, but since I am near slain,
    Kill me outright with looks, and rid my pain.


                     140
  Be wise as thou art cruel, do not press
  My tongue-tied patience with too much disdain:
  Lest sorrow lend me words and words express,
  The manner of my pity-wanting pain.
  If I might teach thee wit better it were,
  Though not to love, yet love to tell me so,
  As testy sick men when their deaths be near,
  No news but health from their physicians know.
  For if I should despair I should grow mad,
  And in my madness might speak ill of thee,
  Now this ill-wresting world is grown so bad,
  Mad slanderers by mad ears believed be.
    That I may not be so, nor thou belied,
    Bear thine eyes straight, though thy proud heart go wide.


                     141
  In faith I do not love thee with mine eyes,
  For they in thee a thousand errors note,
  But 'tis my heart that loves what they despise,
  Who in despite of view is pleased to dote.
  Nor are mine cars with thy tongue's tune delighted,
  Nor tender feeling to base touches prone,
  Nor taste, nor smell, desire to be invited
  To any sensual feast with thee alone:
  But my five wits, nor my five senses can
  Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee,
  Who leaves unswayed the likeness of a man,
  Thy proud heart's slave and vassal wretch to be:
    Only my plague thus far I count my gain,
    That she that makes me sin, awards me pain.


                     142
  Love is my sin, and thy dear virtue hate,
  Hate of my sin, grounded on sinful loving,
  O but with mine, compare thou thine own state,
  And thou shalt find it merits not reproving,
  Or if it do, not from those lips of thine,
  That have profaned their scarlet ornaments,
  And sealed false bonds of love as oft as mine,
  Robbed others' beds' revenues of their rents.
  Be it lawful I love thee as thou lov'st those,
  Whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee,
  Root pity in thy heart that when it grows,
  Thy pity may deserve to pitied be.
    If thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide,
    By self-example mayst thou be denied.


                     143
  Lo as a careful huswife runs to catch,
  One of her feathered creatures broke away,
  Sets down her babe and makes all swift dispatch
  In pursuit of the thing she would have stay:
  Whilst her neglected child holds her in chase,
  Cries to catch her whose busy care is bent,
  To follow that which flies before her face:
  Not prizing her poor infant's discontent;
  So run'st thou after that which flies from thee,
  Whilst I thy babe chase thee afar behind,
  But if thou catch thy hope turn back to me:
  And play the mother's part, kiss me, be kind.
    So will I pray that thou mayst have thy Will,
    If thou turn back and my loud crying still.


                     144
  Two loves I have of comfort and despair,
  Which like two spirits do suggest me still,
  The better angel is a man right fair:
  The worser spirit a woman coloured ill.
  To win me soon to hell my female evil,
  Tempteth my better angel from my side,
  And would corrupt my saint to be a devil:
  Wooing his purity with her foul pride.
  And whether that my angel be turned fiend,
  Suspect I may, yet not directly tell,
  But being both from me both to each friend,
  I guess one angel in another's hell.
    Yet this shall I ne'er know but live in doubt,
    Till my bad angel fire my good one out.


                     145
  Those lips that Love's own hand did make,
  Breathed forth the sound that said 'I hate',
  To me that languished for her sake:
  But when she saw my woeful state,
  Straight in her heart did mercy come,
  Chiding that tongue that ever sweet,
  Was used in giving gentle doom:
  And taught it thus anew to greet:
  'I hate' she altered with an end,
  That followed it as gentle day,
  Doth follow night who like a fiend
  From heaven to hell is flown away.
    'I hate', from hate away she threw,
    And saved my life saying 'not you'.


                     146
  Poor soul the centre of my sinful earth,
  My sinful earth these rebel powers array,
  Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth
  Painting thy outward walls so costly gay?
  Why so large cost having so short a lease,
  Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend?
  Shall worms inheritors of this excess
  Eat up thy charge? is this thy body's end?
  Then soul live thou upon thy servant's loss,
  And let that pine to aggravate thy store;
  Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross;
  Within be fed, without be rich no more,
    So shall thou feed on death, that feeds on men,
    And death once dead, there's no more dying then.


                     147
  My love is as a fever longing still,
  For that which longer nurseth the disease,
  Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill,
  Th' uncertain sickly appetite to please:
  My reason the physician to my love,
  Angry that his prescriptions are not kept
  Hath left me, and I desperate now approve,
  Desire is death, which physic did except.
  Past cure I am, now reason is past care,
  And frantic-mad with evermore unrest,
  My thoughts and my discourse as mad men's are,
  At random from the truth vainly expressed.
    For I have sworn thee fair, and thought thee bright,
    Who art as black as hell, as dark as night.


                     148
  O me! what eyes hath love put in my head,
  Which have no correspondence with true sight,
  Or if they have, where is my judgment fled,
  That censures falsely what they see aright?
  If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote,
  What means the world to say it is not so?
  If it be not, then love doth well denote,
  Love's eye is not so true as all men's: no,
  How can it? O how can love's eye be true,
  That is so vexed with watching and with tears?
  No marvel then though I mistake my view,
  The sun it self sees not, till heaven clears.
    O cunning love, with tears thou keep'st me blind,
    Lest eyes well-seeing thy foul faults should find.


                     149
  Canst thou O cruel, say I love thee not,
  When I against my self with thee partake?
  Do I not think on thee when I forgot
  Am of my self, all-tyrant, for thy sake?
  Who hateth thee that I do call my friend,
  On whom frown'st thou that I do fawn upon,
  Nay if thou lour'st on me do I not spend
  Revenge upon my self with present moan?
  What merit do I in my self respect,
  That is so proud thy service to despise,
  When all my best doth worship thy defect,
  Commanded by the motion of thine eyes?
    But love hate on for now I know thy mind,
    Those that can see thou lov'st, and I am blind.


                     150
  O from what power hast thou this powerful might,
  With insufficiency my heart to sway,
  To make me give the lie to my true sight,
  And swear that brightness doth not grace the day?
  Whence hast thou this becoming of things ill,
  That in the very refuse of thy deeds,
  There is such strength and warrantise of skill,
  That in my mind thy worst all best exceeds?
  Who taught thee how to make me love thee more,
  The more I hear and see just cause of hate?
  O though I love what others do abhor,
  With others thou shouldst not abhor my state.
    If thy unworthiness raised love in me,
    More worthy I to be beloved of thee.


                     151
  Love is too young to know what conscience is,
  Yet who knows not conscience is born of love?
  Then gentle cheater urge not my amiss,
  Lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove.
  For thou betraying me, I do betray
  My nobler part to my gross body's treason,
  My soul doth tell my body that he may,
  Triumph in love, flesh stays no farther reason,
  But rising at thy name doth point out thee,
  As his triumphant prize, proud of this pride,
  He is contented thy poor drudge to be,
  To stand in thy affairs, fall by thy side.
    No want of conscience hold it that I call,
    Her love, for whose dear love I rise and fall.


                     152
  In loving thee thou know'st I am forsworn,
  But thou art twice forsworn to me love swearing,
  In act thy bed-vow broke and new faith torn,
  In vowing new hate after new love bearing:
  But why of two oaths' breach do I accuse thee,
  When I break twenty? I am perjured most,
  For all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee:
  And all my honest faith in thee is lost.
  For I have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness:
  Oaths of thy love, thy truth, thy constancy,
  And to enlighten thee gave eyes to blindness,
  Or made them swear against the thing they see.
    For I have sworn thee fair: more perjured I,
    To swear against the truth so foul a be.


                     153
  Cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep,
  A maid of Dian's this advantage found,
  And his love-kindling fire did quickly steep
  In a cold valley-fountain of that ground:
  Which borrowed from this holy fire of Love,
  A dateless lively heat still to endure,
  And grew a seeting bath which yet men prove,
  Against strange maladies a sovereign cure:
  But at my mistress' eye Love's brand new-fired,
  The boy for trial needs would touch my breast,
  I sick withal the help of bath desired,
  And thither hied a sad distempered guest.
    But found no cure, the bath for my help lies,
    Where Cupid got new fire; my mistress' eyes.


                     154
  The little Love-god lying once asleep,
  Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,
  Whilst many nymphs that vowed chaste life to keep,
  Came tripping by, but in her maiden hand,
  The fairest votary took up that fire,
  Which many legions of true hearts had warmed,
  And so the general of hot desire,
  Was sleeping by a virgin hand disarmed.
  This brand she quenched in a cool well by,
  Which from Love's fire took heat perpetual,
  Growing a bath and healthful remedy,
  For men discased, but I my mistress' thrall,
    Came there for cure and this by that I prove,
    Love's fire heats water, water cools not love.

SCENE:
Rousillon; Paris; Florence; Marseilles


ACT I. SCENE 1.
Rousillon. The COUNT'S palace

Enter BERTRAM, the COUNTESS OF ROUSILLON, HELENA, and LAFEU, all in black

  COUNTESS. In delivering my son from me, I bury a second husband.
  BERTRAM. And I in going, madam, weep o'er my father's death anew;
    but I must attend his Majesty's command, to whom I am now in
    ward, evermore in subjection.
  LAFEU. You shall find of the King a husband, madam; you, sir, a
    father. He that so generally is at all times good must of
    necessity hold his virtue to you, whose worthiness would stir it
    up where it wanted, rather than lack it where there is such
    abundance.
  COUNTESS. What hope is there of his Majesty's amendment?
  LAFEU. He hath abandon'd his physicians, madam; under whose
    practices he hath persecuted time with hope, and finds no other
    advantage in the process but only the losing of hope by time.
  COUNTESS. This young gentlewoman had a father- O, that 'had,' how
    sad a passage 'tis!-whose skill was almost as great as his
    honesty; had it stretch'd so far, would have made nature
    immortal, and death should have play for lack of work. Would, for
    the King's sake, he were living! I think it would be the death of
    the King's disease.
  LAFEU. How call'd you the man you speak of, madam?
  COUNTESS. He was famous, sir, in his profession, and it was his
    great right to be so- Gerard de Narbon.
  LAFEU. He was excellent indeed, madam; the King very lately spoke
    of him admiringly and mourningly; he was skilful enough to have
    liv'd still, if knowledge could be set up against mortality.
  BERTRAM. What is it, my good lord, the King languishes of?
  LAFEU. A fistula, my lord.
  BERTRAM. I heard not of it before.
  LAFEU. I would it were not notorious. Was this gentlewoman the
    daughter of Gerard de Narbon?
  COUNTESS. His sole child, my lord, and bequeathed to my
    overlooking. I have those hopes of her good that her education
    promises; her dispositions she inherits, which makes fair gifts
    fairer; for where an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities,
    there commendations go with pity-they are virtues and traitors
    too. In her they are the better for their simpleness; she derives
    her honesty, and achieves her goodness.
  LAFEU. Your commendations, madam, get from her tears.
  COUNTESS. 'Tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise in.
    The remembrance of her father never approaches her heart but the
    tyranny of her sorrows takes all livelihood from her cheek. No
    more of this, Helena; go to, no more, lest it be rather thought
    you affect a sorrow than to have-
  HELENA. I do affect a sorrow indeed, but I have it too.
  LAFEU. Moderate lamentation is the right of the dead: excessive
    grief the enemy to the living.
  COUNTESS. If the living be enemy to the grief, the excess makes it
    soon mortal.
  BERTRAM. Madam, I desire your holy wishes.
  LAFEU. How understand we that?
  COUNTESS. Be thou blest, Bertram, and succeed thy father
    In manners, as in shape! Thy blood and virtue
    Contend for empire in thee, and thy goodness
    Share with thy birthright! Love all, trust a few,
    Do wrong to none; be able for thine enemy
    Rather in power than use, and keep thy friend
    Under thy own life's key; be check'd for silence,
    But never tax'd for speech. What heaven more will,
    That thee may furnish, and my prayers pluck down,
    Fall on thy head! Farewell. My lord,
    'Tis an unseason'd courtier; good my lord,
    Advise him.
  LAFEU. He cannot want the best
    That shall attend his love.
  COUNTESS. Heaven bless him! Farewell, Bertram.            Exit
  BERTRAM. The best wishes that can be forg'd in your thoughts be
    servants to you!  [To HELENA]  Be comfortable to my mother, your
    mistress, and make much of her.
  LAFEU. Farewell, pretty lady; you must hold the credit of your
    father.                             Exeunt BERTRAM and LAFEU
  HELENA. O, were that all! I think not on my father;
    And these great tears grace his remembrance more
    Than those I shed for him. What was he like?
    I have forgot him; my imagination
    Carries no favour in't but Bertram's.
    I am undone; there is no living, none,
    If Bertram be away. 'Twere all one
    That I should love a bright particular star
    And think to wed it, he is so above me.
    In his bright radiance and collateral light
    Must I be comforted, not in his sphere.
    Th' ambition in my love thus plagues itself:
    The hind that would be mated by the lion
    Must die for love. 'Twas pretty, though a plague,
    To see him every hour; to sit and draw
    His arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls,
    In our heart's table-heart too capable
    Of every line and trick of his sweet favour.
    But now he's gone, and my idolatrous fancy
    Must sanctify his relics. Who comes here?

                       Enter PAROLLES

    [Aside]  One that goes with him. I love him for his sake;
    And yet I know him a notorious liar,
    Think him a great way fool, solely a coward;
    Yet these fix'd evils sit so fit in him
    That they take place when virtue's steely bones
    Looks bleak i' th' cold wind; withal, full oft we see
    Cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly.
  PAROLLES. Save you, fair queen!
  HELENA. And you, monarch!
  PAROLLES. No.
  HELENA. And no.
  PAROLLES. Are you meditating on virginity?
  HELENA. Ay. You have some stain of soldier in you; let me ask you a
    question. Man is enemy to virginity; how may we barricado it
    against him?
  PAROLLES. Keep him out.
  HELENA. But he assails; and our virginity, though valiant in the
    defence, yet is weak. Unfold to us some warlike resistance.
  PAROLLES. There is none. Man, setting down before you, will
    undermine you and blow you up.
  HELENA. Bless our poor virginity from underminers and blowers-up!
    Is there no military policy how virgins might blow up men?
  PAROLLES. Virginity being blown down, man will quicklier be blown
    up; marry, in blowing him down again, with the breach yourselves
     made, you lose your city. It is not politic in the commonwealth
    of nature to preserve virginity. Loss of virginity is rational
    increase; and there was never virgin got till virginity was first
    lost. That you were made of is metal to make virgins. Virginity
    by being once lost may be ten times found; by being ever kept, it
    is ever lost. 'Tis too cold a companion; away with't.
  HELENA. I will stand for 't a little, though therefore I die a
    virgin.
  PAROLLES. There's little can be said in 't; 'tis against the rule
    of nature. To speak on the part of virginity is to accuse your
    mothers; which is most infallible disobedience. He that hangs
    himself is a virgin; virginity murders itself, and should be
    buried in highways, out of all sanctified limit, as a desperate
    offendress against nature. Virginity breeds mites, much like a
    cheese; consumes itself to the very paring, and so dies with
    feeding his own stomach. Besides, virginity is peevish, proud,
    idle, made of self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the
    canon. Keep it not; you cannot choose but lose by't. Out with't.
    Within ten year it will make itself ten, which is a goodly
    increase; and the principal itself not much the worse. Away
    with't.
  HELENA. How might one do, sir, to lose it to her own liking?
  PAROLLES. Let me see. Marry, ill to like him that ne'er it likes.
    'Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with lying; the longer kept,
    the less worth. Off with't while 'tis vendible; answer the time
    of request. Virginity, like an old courtier, wears her cap out of
    fashion, richly suited but unsuitable; just like the brooch and
    the toothpick, which wear not now. Your date is better in your
    pie and your porridge than in your cheek. And your virginity,
    your old virginity, is like one of our French wither'd pears: it
    looks ill, it eats drily; marry, 'tis a wither'd pear; it was
    formerly better; marry, yet 'tis a wither'd pear. Will you
    anything with it?
  HELENA. Not my virginity yet.
    There shall your master have a thousand loves,
    A mother, and a mistress, and a friend,
    A phoenix, captain, and an enemy,
    A guide, a goddess, and a sovereign,
    A counsellor, a traitress, and a dear;
    His humble ambition, proud humility,
    His jarring concord, and his discord dulcet,
    His faith, his sweet disaster; with a world
    Of pretty, fond, adoptious christendoms
    That blinking Cupid gossips. Now shall he-
    I know not what he shall. God send him well!
    The court's a learning-place, and he is one-
  PAROLLES. What one, i' faith?
  HELENA. That I wish well. 'Tis pity-
  PAROLLES. What's pity?
  HELENA. That wishing well had not a body in't
    Which might be felt; that we, the poorer born,
    Whose baser stars do shut us up in wishes,
    Might with effects of them follow our friends
    And show what we alone must think, which never
    Returns us thanks.

  PAGE. Monsieur Parolles, my lord calls for you.      Exit PAGE
  PAROLLES. Little Helen, farewell; if I can remember thee, I will
    think of thee at court.
  HELENA. Monsieur Parolles, you were born under a charitable star.
  PAROLLES. Under Mars, I.
  HELENA. I especially think, under Mars.
  PAROLLES. Why under Man?
  HELENA. The wars hath so kept you under that you must needs be born
    under Mars.
  PAROLLES. When he was predominant.
  HELENA. When he was retrograde, I think, rather.
  PAROLLES. Why think you so?
  HELENA. You go so much backward when you fight.
  PAROLLES. That's for advantage.
  HELENA. So is running away, when fear proposes the safety: but the
    composition that your valour and fear makes in you is a virtue of
    a good wing, and I like the wear well.
  PAROLLES. I am so full of business I cannot answer thee acutely. I
    will return perfect courtier; in the which my instruction shall
    serve to naturalize thee, so thou wilt be capable of a courtier's
    counsel, and understand what advice shall thrust upon thee; else
    thou diest in thine unthankfulness, and thine ignorance makes
    thee away. Farewell. When thou hast leisure, say thy prayers;
    when thou hast none, remember thy friends. Get thee a good
    husband and use him as he uses thee. So, farewell.
 Exit
  HELENA. Our remedies oft in ourselves do lie,
    Which we ascribe to heaven. The fated sky
    Gives us free scope; only doth backward pull
    Our slow designs when we ourselves are dull.
    What power is it which mounts my love so high,
    That makes me see, and cannot feed mine eye?
    The mightiest space in fortune nature brings
    To join like likes, and kiss like native things.
    Impossible be strange attempts to those
    That weigh their pains in sense, and do suppose
    What hath been cannot be. Who ever strove
    To show her merit that did miss her love?
    The King's disease-my project may deceive me,
    But my intents are fix'd, and will not leave me.        Exit




ACT I. SCENE 2.
Paris. The KING'S palace

Flourish of cornets. Enter the KING OF FRANCE, with letters,
and divers ATTENDANTS

  KING. The Florentines and Senoys are by th' ears;
    Have fought with equal fortune, and continue
    A braving war.
  FIRST LORD. So 'tis reported, sir.
  KING. Nay, 'tis most credible. We here receive it,
    A certainty, vouch'd from our cousin Austria,
    With caution, that the Florentine will move us
    For speedy aid; wherein our dearest friend
    Prejudicates the business, and would seem
    To have us make denial.
  FIRST LORD. His love and wisdom,
    Approv'd so to your Majesty, may plead
    For amplest credence.
  KING. He hath arm'd our answer,
    And Florence is denied before he comes;
    Yet, for our gentlemen that mean to see
    The Tuscan service, freely have they leave
    To stand on either part.
  SECOND LORD. It well may serve
    A nursery to our gentry, who are sick
    For breathing and exploit.
  KING. What's he comes here?

              Enter BERTRAM, LAFEU, and PAROLLES

  FIRST LORD. It is the Count Rousillon, my good lord,
    Young Bertram.
  KING. Youth, thou bear'st thy father's face;
    Frank nature, rather curious than in haste,
    Hath well compos'd thee. Thy father's moral parts
    Mayst thou inherit too! Welcome to Paris.
  BERTRAM. My thanks and duty are your Majesty's.
  KING. I would I had that corporal soundness now,
    As when thy father and myself in friendship
    First tried our soldiership. He did look far
    Into the service of the time, and was
    Discipled of the bravest. He lasted long;
    But on us both did haggish age steal on,
    And wore us out of act. It much repairs me
    To talk of your good father. In his youth
    He had the wit which I can well observe
    To-day in our young lords; but they may jest
    Till their own scorn return to them unnoted
    Ere they can hide their levity in honour.
    So like a courtier, contempt nor bitterness
    Were in his pride or sharpness; if they were,
    His equal had awak'd them; and his honour,
    Clock to itself, knew the true minute when
    Exception bid him speak, and at this time
    His tongue obey'd his hand. Who were below him
    He us'd as creatures of another place;
    And bow'd his eminent top to their low ranks,
    Making them proud of his humility
    In their poor praise he humbled. Such a man
    Might be a copy to these younger times;
    Which, followed well, would demonstrate them now
    But goers backward.
  BERTRAM. His good remembrance, sir,
    Lies richer in your thoughts than on his tomb;
    So in approof lives not his epitaph
    As in your royal speech.
  KING. Would I were with him! He would always say-
    Methinks I hear him now; his plausive words
    He scatter'd not in ears, but grafted them
    To grow there, and to bear- 'Let me not live'-
    This his good melancholy oft began,
    On the catastrophe and heel of pastime,
    When it was out-'Let me not live' quoth he
    'After my flame lacks oil, to be the snuff
    Of younger spirits, whose apprehensive senses
    All but new things disdain; whose judgments are
    Mere fathers of their garments; whose constancies
    Expire before their fashions.' This he wish'd.
    I, after him, do after him wish too,
    Since I nor wax nor honey can bring home,
    I quickly were dissolved from my hive,
    To give some labourers room.
  SECOND LORD. You're loved, sir;
    They that least lend it you shall lack you first.
  KING. I fill a place, I know't. How long is't, Count,
    Since the physician at your father's died?
    He was much fam'd.
  BERTRAM. Some six months since, my lord.
  KING. If he were living, I would try him yet-
    Lend me an arm-the rest have worn me out
    With several applications. Nature and sickness
    Debate it at their leisure. Welcome, Count;
    My son's no dearer.
  BERTRAM. Thank your Majesty.                 Exeunt [Flourish]




ACT I. SCENE 3.
Rousillon. The COUNT'S palace

Enter COUNTESS, STEWARD, and CLOWN

  COUNTESS. I will now hear; what say you of this gentlewoman?
  STEWARD. Madam, the care I have had to even your content I wish
    might be found in the calendar of my past endeavours; for then we
    wound our modesty, and make foul the clearness of our deservings,
    when of ourselves we publish them.
  COUNTESS. What does this knave here? Get you gone, sirrah. The
    complaints I have heard of you I do not all believe; 'tis my
    slowness that I do not, for I know you lack not folly to commit
    them and have ability enough to make such knaveries yours.
  CLOWN. 'Tis not unknown to you, madam, I am a poor fellow.
  COUNTESS. Well, sir.
  CLOWN. No, madam, 'tis not so well that I am poor, though many of
    the rich are damn'd; but if I may have your ladyship's good will
    to go to the world, Isbel the woman and I will do as we may.
  COUNTESS. Wilt thou needs be a beggar?
  CLOWN. I do beg your good will in this case.
  COUNTESS. In what case?
  CLOWN. In Isbel's case and mine own. Service is no heritage; and I
    think I shall never have the blessing of God till I have issue o'
    my body; for they say bames are blessings.
  COUNTESS. Tell me thy reason why thou wilt marry.
  CLOWN. My poor body, madam, requires it. I am driven on by the
    flesh; and he must needs go that the devil drives.
  COUNTESS. Is this all your worship's reason?
  CLOWN. Faith, madam, I have other holy reasons, such as they are.
  COUNTESS. May the world know them?
  CLOWN. I have been, madam, a wicked creature, as you and all flesh
    and blood are; and, indeed, I do marry that I may repent.
  COUNTESS. Thy marriage, sooner than thy wickedness.
  CLOWN. I am out o' friends, madam, and I hope to have friends for
    my wife's sake.
  COUNTESS. Such friends are thine enemies, knave.
  CLOWN. Y'are shallow, madam-in great friends; for the knaves come
    to do that for me which I am aweary of. He that ears my land
    spares my team, and gives me leave to in the crop. If I be his
    cuckold, he's my drudge. He that comforts my wife is the
    cherisher of my flesh and blood; he that cherishes my flesh and
    blood loves my flesh and blood; he that loves my flesh and blood
    is my friend; ergo, he that kisses my wife is my friend. If men
    could be contented to be what they are, there were no fear in
    marriage; for young Charbon the puritan and old Poysam the
    papist, howsome'er their hearts are sever'd in religion, their
    heads are both one; they may jowl horns together like any deer
    i' th' herd.
  COUNTESS. Wilt thou ever be a foul-mouth'd and calumnious knave?
  CLOWN. A prophet I, madam; and I speak the truth the next way:

              For I the ballad will repeat,
                Which men full true shall find:
              Your marriage comes by destiny,
                Your cuckoo sings by kind.

  COUNTESS. Get you gone, sir; I'll talk with you more anon.
  STEWARD. May it please you, madam, that he bid Helen come to you.
    Of her I am to speak.
  COUNTESS. Sirrah, tell my gentlewoman I would speak with her; Helen
    I mean.
  CLOWN.  [Sings]

               'Was this fair face the cause' quoth she
                 'Why the Grecians sacked Troy?
               Fond done, done fond,
                 Was this King Priam's joy?'
               With that she sighed as she stood,
               With that she sighed as she stood,
                 And gave this sentence then:
               'Among nine bad if one be good,
               Among nine bad if one be good,
                 There's yet one good in ten.'

  COUNTESS. What, one good in ten? You corrupt the song, sirrah.
  CLOWN. One good woman in ten, madam, which is a purifying o' th'
    song. Would God would serve the world so all the year! We'd find
    no fault with the tithe-woman, if I were the parson. One in ten,
    quoth 'a! An we might have a good woman born before every blazing
    star, or at an earthquake, 'twould mend the lottery well: a man
    may draw his heart out ere 'a pluck one.
  COUNTESS. You'll be gone, sir knave, and do as I command you.
  CLOWN. That man should be at woman's command, and yet no hurt done!
    Though honesty be no puritan, yet it will do no hurt; it will
    wear the surplice of humility over the black gown of a big heart.
    I am going, forsooth. The business is for Helen to come hither.
 Exit
  COUNTESS. Well, now.
  STEWARD. I know, madam, you love your gentlewoman entirely.
  COUNTESS. Faith I do. Her father bequeath'd her to me; and she
    herself, without other advantage, may lawfully make title to as
    much love as she finds. There is more owing her than is paid; and
    more shall be paid her than she'll demand.
  STEWARD. Madam, I was very late more near her than I think she
    wish'd me. Alone she was, and did communicate to herself her own
    words to her own ears; she thought, I dare vow for her, they
    touch'd not any stranger sense. Her matter was, she loved your
    son. Fortune, she said, was no goddess, that had put such
    difference betwixt their two estates; Love no god, that would not
    extend his might only where qualities were level; Diana no queen
    of virgins, that would suffer her poor knight surpris'd without
    rescue in the first assault, or ransom afterward. This she
    deliver'd in the most bitter touch of sorrow that e'er I heard
    virgin exclaim in; which I held my duty speedily to acquaint you
    withal; sithence, in the loss that may happen, it concerns you
    something to know it.
  COUNTESS. YOU have discharg'd this honestly; keep it to yourself.
    Many likelihoods inform'd me of this before, which hung so
    tott'ring in the balance that I could neither believe nor
    misdoubt. Pray you leave me. Stall this in your bosom; and I
    thank you for your honest care. I will speak with you further
    anon.                                           Exit STEWARD

                            Enter HELENA

    Even so it was with me when I was young.
    If ever we are nature's, these are ours; this thorn
    Doth to our rose of youth rightly belong;
    Our blood to us, this to our blood is born.
    It is the show and seal of nature's truth,
    Where love's strong passion is impress'd in youth.
    By our remembrances of days foregone,
    Such were our faults, or then we thought them none.
    Her eye is sick on't; I observe her now.
  HELENA. What is your pleasure, madam?
  COUNTESS. You know, Helen,
    I am a mother to you.
  HELENA. Mine honourable mistress.
  COUNTESS. Nay, a mother.
    Why not a mother? When I said 'a mother,'
    Methought you saw a serpent. What's in 'mother'
    That you start at it? I say I am your mother,
    And put you in the catalogue of those
    That were enwombed mine. 'Tis often seen
    Adoption strives with nature, and choice breeds
    A native slip to us from foreign seeds.
    You ne'er oppress'd me with a mother's groan,
    Yet I express to you a mother's care.
    God's mercy, maiden! does it curd thy blood
    To say I am thy mother? What's the matter,
    That this distempered messenger of wet,
    The many-colour'd Iris, rounds thine eye?
    Why, that you are my daughter?
  HELENA. That I am not.
  COUNTESS. I say I am your mother.
  HELENA. Pardon, madam.
    The Count Rousillon cannot be my brother:
    I am from humble, he from honoured name;
    No note upon my parents, his all noble.
    My master, my dear lord he is; and I
    His servant live, and will his vassal die.
    He must not be my brother.
  COUNTESS. Nor I your mother?
  HELENA. You are my mother, madam; would you were-
    So that my lord your son were not my brother-
    Indeed my mother! Or were you both our mothers,
    I care no more for than I do for heaven,
    So I were not his sister. Can't no other,
    But, I your daughter, he must be my brother?
  COUNTESS. Yes, Helen, you might be my daughter-in-law.
    God shield you mean it not! 'daughter' and 'mother'
    So strive upon your pulse. What! pale again?
    My fear hath catch'd your fondness. Now I see
    The myst'ry of your loneliness, and find
    Your salt tears' head. Now to all sense 'tis gross
    You love my son; invention is asham'd,
    Against the proclamation of thy passion,
    To say thou dost not. Therefore tell me true;
    But tell me then, 'tis so; for, look, thy cheeks
    Confess it, th' one to th' other; and thine eyes
    See it so grossly shown in thy behaviours
    That in their kind they speak it; only sin
    And hellish obstinacy tie thy tongue,
    That truth should be suspected. Speak, is't so?
    If it be so, you have wound a goodly clew;
    If it be not, forswear't; howe'er, I charge thee,
    As heaven shall work in me for thine avail,
    To tell me truly.
  HELENA. Good madam, pardon me.
  COUNTESS. Do you love my son?
  HELENA. Your pardon, noble mistress.
  COUNTESS. Love you my son?
  HELENA. Do not you love him, madam?
  COUNTESS. Go not about; my love hath in't a bond
    Whereof the world takes note. Come, come, disclose
    The state of your affection; for your passions
    Have to the full appeach'd.
  HELENA. Then I confess,
    Here on my knee, before high heaven and you,
    That before you, and next unto high heaven,
    I love your son.
    My friends were poor, but honest; so's my love.
    Be not offended, for it hurts not him
    That he is lov'd of me; I follow him not
    By any token of presumptuous suit,
    Nor would I have him till I do deserve him;
    Yet never know how that desert should be.
    I know I love in vain, strive against hope;
    Yet in this captious and intenible sieve
    I still pour in the waters of my love,
    And lack not to lose still. Thus, Indian-like,
    Religious in mine error, I adore
    The sun that looks upon his worshipper
    But knows of him no more. My dearest madam,
    Let not your hate encounter with my love,
    For loving where you do; but if yourself,
    Whose aged honour cites a virtuous youth,
    Did ever in so true a flame of liking
    Wish chastely and love dearly that your Dian
    Was both herself and Love; O, then, give pity
    To her whose state is such that cannot choose
    But lend and give where she is sure to lose;
    That seeks not to find that her search implies,
    But, riddle-like, lives sweetly where she dies!
  COUNTESS. Had you not lately an intent-speak truly-
    To go to Paris?
  HELENA. Madam, I had.
  COUNTESS. Wherefore? Tell true.
  HELENA. I will tell truth; by grace itself I swear.
    You know my father left me some prescriptions
    Of rare and prov'd effects, such as his reading
    And manifest experience had collected
    For general sovereignty; and that he will'd me
    In heedfull'st reservation to bestow them,
    As notes whose faculties inclusive were
    More than they were in note. Amongst the rest
    There is a remedy, approv'd, set down,
    To cure the desperate languishings whereof
    The King is render'd lost.
  COUNTESS. This was your motive
    For Paris, was it? Speak.
  HELENA. My lord your son made me to think of this,
    Else Paris, and the medicine, and the King,
    Had from the conversation of my thoughts
    Haply been absent then.
  COUNTESS. But think you, Helen,
    If you should tender your supposed aid,
    He would receive it? He and his physicians
    Are of a mind: he, that they cannot help him;
    They, that they cannot help. How shall they credit
    A poor unlearned virgin, when the schools,
    Embowell'd of their doctrine, have let off
    The danger to itself?
  HELENA. There's something in't
    More than my father's skill, which was the great'st
    Of his profession, that his good receipt
    Shall for my legacy be sanctified
    By th' luckiest stars in heaven; and, would your honour
    But give me leave to try success, I'd venture
    The well-lost life of mine on his Grace's cure.
    By such a day and hour.
  COUNTESS. Dost thou believe't?
  HELENA. Ay, madam, knowingly.
  COUNTESS. Why, Helen, thou shalt have my leave and love,
    Means and attendants, and my loving greetings
    To those of mine in court. I'll stay at home,
    And pray God's blessing into thy attempt.
    Be gone to-morrow; and be sure of this,
    What I can help thee to thou shalt not miss.          Exeunt

ACT II. SCENE 1.
Paris. The KING'S palace

Flourish of cornets. Enter the KING with divers young LORDS taking leave
for the Florentine war; BERTRAM and PAROLLES; ATTENDANTS

  KING. Farewell, young lords; these war-like principles
    Do not throw from you. And you, my lords, farewell;
    Share the advice betwixt you; if both gain all,
    The gift doth stretch itself as 'tis receiv'd,
    And is enough for both.
  FIRST LORD. 'Tis our hope, sir,
    After well-ent'red soldiers, to return
    And find your Grace in health.
  KING. No, no, it cannot be; and yet my heart
    Will not confess he owes the malady
    That doth my life besiege. Farewell, young lords;
    Whether I live or die, be you the sons
    Of worthy Frenchmen; let higher Italy-
    Those bated that inherit but the fall
    Of the last monarchy-see that you come
    Not to woo honour, but to wed it; when
    The bravest questant shrinks, find what you seek,
    That fame may cry you aloud. I say farewell.
  SECOND LORD. Health, at your bidding, serve your Majesty!
  KING. Those girls of Italy, take heed of them;
    They say our French lack language to deny,
    If they demand; beware of being captives
    Before you serve.
    BOTH. Our hearts receive your warnings.
  KING. Farewell.  [To ATTENDANTS]  Come hither to me.
                                       The KING retires attended
  FIRST LORD. O my sweet lord, that you will stay behind us!
  PAROLLES. 'Tis not his fault, the spark.
    SECOND LORD. O, 'tis brave wars!
  PAROLLES. Most admirable! I have seen those wars.
  BERTRAM. I am commanded here and kept a coil with
    'Too young' and next year' and "Tis too early.'
  PAROLLES. An thy mind stand to 't, boy, steal away bravely.
  BERTRAM. I shall stay here the forehorse to a smock,
    Creaking my shoes on the plain masonry,
    Till honour be bought up, and no sword worn
    But one to dance with. By heaven, I'll steal away.
  FIRST LORD. There's honour in the theft.
  PAROLLES. Commit it, Count.
  SECOND LORD. I am your accessary; and so farewell.
  BERTRAM. I grow to you, and our parting is a tortur'd body.
  FIRST LORD. Farewell, Captain.
  SECOND LORD. Sweet Monsieur Parolles!
  PAROLLES. Noble heroes, my sword and yours are kin. Good sparks and
    lustrous, a word, good metals: you shall find in the regiment of
    the Spinii one Captain Spurio, with his cicatrice, an emblem of
    war, here on his sinister cheek; it was this very sword
    entrench'd it. Say to him I live; and observe his reports for me.
  FIRST LORD. We shall, noble Captain.
  PAROLLES. Mars dote on you for his novices!       Exeunt LORDS
    What will ye do?

                            Re-enter the KING

  BERTRAM. Stay; the King!
  PAROLLES. Use a more spacious ceremony to the noble lords; you have
    restrain'd yourself within the list of too cold an adieu. Be more
    expressive to them; for they wear themselves in the cap of the
    time; there do muster true gait; eat, speak, and move, under the
    influence of the most receiv'd star; and though the devil lead
    the measure, such are to be followed. After them, and take a more
    dilated farewell.
  BERTRAM. And I will do so.
  PAROLLES. Worthy fellows; and like to prove most sinewy sword-men.
                                     Exeunt BERTRAM and PAROLLES

                              Enter LAFEU

  LAFEU.  [Kneeling]  Pardon, my lord, for me and for my tidings.
  KING. I'll fee thee to stand up.
  LAFEU. Then here's a man stands that has brought his pardon.
    I would you had kneel'd, my lord, to ask me mercy;
    And that at my bidding you could so stand up.
  KING. I would I had; so I had broke thy pate,
    And ask'd thee mercy for't.
  LAFEU. Good faith, across!
    But, my good lord, 'tis thus: will you be cur'd
    Of your infirmity?
  KING. No.
  LAFEU. O, will you eat
    No grapes, my royal fox? Yes, but you will
    My noble grapes, an if my royal fox
    Could reach them: I have seen a medicine
    That's able to breathe life into a stone,
    Quicken a rock, and make you dance canary
    With spritely fire and motion; whose simple touch
    Is powerful to araise King Pepin, nay,
    To give great Charlemain a pen in's hand
    And write to her a love-line.
  KING. What her is this?
  LAFEU. Why, Doctor She! My lord, there's one arriv'd,
    If you will see her. Now, by my faith and honour,
    If seriously I may convey my thoughts
    In this my light deliverance, I have spoke
    With one that in her sex, her years, profession,
    Wisdom, and constancy, hath amaz'd me more
    Than I dare blame my weakness. Will you see her,
    For that is her demand, and know her business?
    That done, laugh well at me.
  KING. Now, good Lafeu,
    Bring in the admiration, that we with the
    May spend our wonder too, or take off thine
    By wond'ring how thou took'st it.
  LAFEU. Nay, I'll fit you,
    And not be all day neither.                       Exit LAFEU
  KING. Thus he his special nothing ever prologues.

                   Re-enter LAFEU with HELENA

  LAFEU. Nay, come your ways.
  KING. This haste hath wings indeed.
  LAFEU. Nay, come your ways;
    This is his Majesty; say your mind to him.
    A traitor you do look like; but such traitors
    His Majesty seldom fears. I am Cressid's uncle,
    That dare leave two together. Fare you well.            Exit
  KING. Now, fair one, does your business follow us?
  HELENA. Ay, my good lord.
    Gerard de Narbon was my father,
    In what he did profess, well found.
  KING. I knew him.
  HELENA. The rather will I spare my praises towards him;
    Knowing him is enough. On's bed of death
    Many receipts he gave me; chiefly one,
    Which, as the dearest issue of his practice,
    And of his old experience th' only darling,
    He bade me store up as a triple eye,
    Safer than mine own two, more dear. I have so:
    And, hearing your high Majesty is touch'd
    With that malignant cause wherein the honour
    Of my dear father's gift stands chief in power,
    I come to tender it, and my appliance,
    With all bound humbleness.
  KING. We thank you, maiden;
    But may not be so credulous of cure,
    When our most learned doctors leave us, and
    The congregated college have concluded
    That labouring art can never ransom nature
    From her inaidable estate-I say we must not
    So stain our judgment, or corrupt our hope,
    To prostitute our past-cure malady
    To empirics; or to dissever so
    Our great self and our credit to esteem
    A senseless help, when help past sense we deem.
  HELENA. My duty then shall pay me for my pains.
    I will no more enforce mine office on you;
    Humbly entreating from your royal thoughts
    A modest one to bear me back again.
  KING. I cannot give thee less, to be call'd grateful.
    Thou thought'st to help me; and such thanks I give
    As one near death to those that wish him live.
    But what at full I know, thou know'st no part;
    I knowing all my peril, thou no art.
  HELENA. What I can do can do no hurt to try,
    Since you set up your rest 'gainst remedy.
    He that of greatest works is finisher
    Oft does them by the weakest minister.
    So holy writ in babes hath judgment shown,
    When judges have been babes. Great floods have flown
    From simple sources, and great seas have dried
    When miracles have by the greatest been denied.
    Oft expectation fails, and most oft there
    Where most it promises; and oft it hits
    Where hope is coldest, and despair most fits.
  KING. I must not hear thee. Fare thee well, kind maid;
    Thy pains, not us'd, must by thyself be paid;
    Proffers not took reap thanks for their reward.
  HELENA. Inspired merit so by breath is barr'd.
    It is not so with Him that all things knows,
    As 'tis with us that square our guess by shows;
    But most it is presumption in us when
    The help of heaven we count the act of men.
    Dear sir, to my endeavours give consent;
    Of heaven, not me, make an experiment.
    I am not an impostor, that proclaim
    Myself against the level of mine aim;
    But know I think, and think I know most sure,
    My art is not past power nor you past cure.
  KING. Art thou so confident? Within what space
    Hop'st thou my cure?
  HELENA. The greatest Grace lending grace.
    Ere twice the horses of the sun shall bring
    Their fiery torcher his diurnal ring,
    Ere twice in murk and occidental damp
    Moist Hesperus hath quench'd his sleepy lamp,
    Or four and twenty times the pilot's glass
    Hath told the thievish minutes how they pass,
    What is infirm from your sound parts shall fly,
    Health shall live free, and sickness freely die.
  KING. Upon thy certainty and confidence
    What dar'st thou venture?
  HELENA. Tax of impudence,
    A strumpet's boldness, a divulged shame,
    Traduc'd by odious ballads; my maiden's name
    Sear'd otherwise; ne worse of worst-extended
    With vilest torture let my life be ended.
  KING. Methinks in thee some blessed spirit doth speak
    His powerful sound within an organ weak;
    And what impossibility would slay
    In common sense, sense saves another way.
    Thy life is dear; for all that life can rate
    Worth name of life in thee hath estimate:
    Youth, beauty, wisdom, courage, all
    That happiness and prime can happy call.
    Thou this to hazard needs must intimate
    Skill infinite or monstrous desperate.
    Sweet practiser, thy physic I will try,
    That ministers thine own death if I die.
  HELENA. If I break time, or flinch in property
    Of what I spoke, unpitied let me die;
    And well deserv'd. Not helping, death's my fee;
    But, if I help, what do you promise me?
  KING. Make thy demand.
  HELENA. But will you make it even?
  KING. Ay, by my sceptre and my hopes of heaven.
  HELENA. Then shalt thou give me with thy kingly hand
    What husband in thy power I will command.
    Exempted be from me the arrogance
    To choose from forth the royal blood of France,
    My low and humble name to propagate
    With any branch or image of thy state;
    But such a one, thy vassal, whom I know
    Is free for me to ask, thee to bestow.
  KING. Here is my hand; the premises observ'd,
    Thy will by my performance shall be serv'd.
    So make the choice of thy own time, for I,
    Thy resolv'd patient, on thee still rely.
    More should I question thee, and more I must,
    Though more to know could not be more to trust,
    From whence thou cam'st, how tended on. But rest
    Unquestion'd welcome and undoubted blest.
    Give me some help here, ho! If thou proceed
    As high as word, my deed shall match thy deed.
                                              [Flourish. Exeunt]




ACT II. SCENE 2.
Rousillon. The COUNT'S palace

Enter COUNTESS and CLOWN

  COUNTESS. Come on, sir; I shall now put you to the height of your
    breeding.
  CLOWN. I will show myself highly fed and lowly taught. I know my
    business is but to the court.
  COUNTESS. To the court! Why, what place make you special, when you
    put off that with such contempt? But to the court!
  CLOWN. Truly, madam, if God have lent a man any manners, he may
    easily put it off at court. He that cannot make a leg, put off's
    cap, kiss his hand, and say nothing, has neither leg, hands, lip,
    nor cap; and indeed such a fellow, to say precisely, were not for
    the court; but for me, I have an answer will serve all men.
  COUNTESS. Marry, that's a bountiful answer that fits all questions.
  CLOWN. It is like a barber's chair, that fits all buttocks-the pin
    buttock, the quatch buttock, the brawn buttock, or any buttock.
  COUNTESS. Will your answer serve fit to all questions?
  CLOWN. As fit as ten groats is for the hand of an attorney, as your
    French crown for your taffety punk, as Tib's rush for Tom's
    forefinger, as a pancake for Shrove Tuesday, a morris for Mayday,
    as the nail to his hole, the cuckold to his horn, as a scolding
    quean to a wrangling knave, as the nun's lip to the friar's
    mouth; nay, as the pudding to his skin.
  COUNTESS. Have you, I, say, an answer of such fitness for all
    questions?
  CLOWN. From below your duke to beneath your constable, it will fit
    any question.
  COUNTESS. It must be an answer of most monstrous size that must fit
    all demands.
  CLOWN. But a trifle neither, in good faith, if the learned should
    speak truth of it. Here it is, and all that belongs to't. Ask me
    if I am a courtier: it shall do you no harm to learn.
  COUNTESS. To be young again, if we could, I will be a fool in
    question, hoping to be the wiser by your answer. I pray you, sir,
    are you a courtier?
  CLOWN. O Lord, sir!-There's a simple putting off. More, more, a
    hundred of them.
  COUNTESS. Sir, I am a poor friend of yours, that loves you.
  CLOWN. O Lord, sir!-Thick, thick; spare not me.
  COUNTESS. I think, sir, you can eat none of this homely meat.
  CLOWN. O Lord, sir!-Nay, put me to't, I warrant you.
  COUNTESS. You were lately whipp'd, sir, as I think.
  CLOWN. O Lord, sir!-Spare not me.
  COUNTESS. Do you cry 'O Lord, sir!' at your whipping, and 'spare
    not me'? Indeed your 'O Lord, sir!' is very sequent to your
    whipping. You would answer very well to a whipping, if you were
    but bound to't.
  CLOWN. I ne'er had worse luck in my life in my 'O Lord, sir!' I see
    thing's may serve long, but not serve ever.
  COUNTESS. I play the noble housewife with the time,
    To entertain it so merrily with a fool.
  CLOWN. O Lord, sir!-Why, there't serves well again.
  COUNTESS. An end, sir! To your business: give Helen this,
    And urge her to a present answer back;
    Commend me to my kinsmen and my son. This is not much.
  CLOWN. Not much commendation to them?
  COUNTESS. Not much employment for you. You understand me?
  CLOWN. Most fruitfully; I am there before my legs.
  COUNTESS. Haste you again.                              Exeunt




ACT II. SCENE 3.
Paris. The KING'S palace

Enter BERTRAM, LAFEU, and PAROLLES

  LAFEU. They say miracles are past; and we have our philosophical
    persons to make modern and familiar things supernatural and
    causeless. Hence is it that we make trifles of terrors,
    ensconcing ourselves into seeming knowledge when we should submit
    ourselves to an unknown fear.
  PAROLLES. Why, 'tis the rarest argument of wonder that hath shot
    out in our latter times.
  BERTRAM. And so 'tis.
  LAFEU. To be relinquish'd of the artists-
  PAROLLES. So I say-both of Galen and Paracelsus.
  LAFEU. Of all the learned and authentic fellows-
  PAROLLES. Right; so I say.
  LAFEU. That gave him out incurable-
  PAROLLES. Why, there 'tis; so say I too.
  LAFEU. Not to be help'd-
  PAROLLES. Right; as 'twere a man assur'd of a-
  LAFEU. Uncertain life and sure death.
  PAROLLES. Just; you say well; so would I have said.
  LAFEU. I may truly say it is a novelty to the world.
  PAROLLES. It is indeed. If you will have it in showing, you shall
    read it in what-do-ye-call't here.
  LAFEU.  [Reading the ballad title]  'A Showing of a Heavenly
    Effect in an Earthly Actor.'
  PAROLLES. That's it; I would have said the very same.
  LAFEU. Why, your dolphin is not lustier. 'Fore me, I speak in
    respect-
  PAROLLES. Nay, 'tis strange, 'tis very strange; that is the brief
    and the tedious of it; and he's of a most facinerious spirit that
    will not acknowledge it to be the-
  LAFEU. Very hand of heaven.
  PAROLLES. Ay; so I say.
  LAFEU. In a most weak-
  PAROLLES. And debile minister, great power, great transcendence;
    which should, indeed, give us a further use to be made than alone
    the recov'ry of the King, as to be-
  LAFEU. Generally thankful.

                 Enter KING, HELENA, and ATTENDANTS

  PAROLLES. I would have said it; you say well. Here comes the King.
  LAFEU. Lustig, as the Dutchman says. I'll like a maid the better,
    whilst I have a tooth in my head. Why, he's able to lead her a
    coranto.
  PAROLLES. Mort du vinaigre! Is not this Helen?
  LAFEU. 'Fore God, I think so.
  KING. Go, call before me all the lords in court.
                                               Exit an ATTENDANT
    Sit, my preserver, by thy patient's side;
    And with this healthful hand, whose banish'd sense
    Thou has repeal'd, a second time receive
    The confirmation of my promis'd gift,
    Which but attends thy naming.

                     Enter three or four LORDS

    Fair maid, send forth thine eye. This youthful parcel
    Of noble bachelors stand at my bestowing,
    O'er whom both sovereign power and father's voice
    I have to use. Thy frank election make;
    Thou hast power to choose, and they none to forsake.
  HELENA. To each of you one fair and virtuous mistress
    Fall, when love please. Marry, to each but one!
  LAFEU. I'd give bay Curtal and his furniture
    My mouth no more were broken than these boys',
    And writ as little beard.
  KING. Peruse them well.
    Not one of those but had a noble father.
  HELENA. Gentlemen,
    Heaven hath through me restor'd the King to health.
  ALL. We understand it, and thank heaven for you.
  HELENA. I am a simple maid, and therein wealthiest
    That I protest I simply am a maid.
    Please it your Majesty, I have done already.
    The blushes in my cheeks thus whisper me:
    'We blush that thou shouldst choose; but, be refused,
    Let the white death sit on thy cheek for ever,
    We'll ne'er come there again.'
  KING. Make choice and see:
    Who shuns thy love shuns all his love in me.
  HELENA. Now, Dian, from thy altar do I fly,
    And to imperial Love, that god most high,
    Do my sighs stream. Sir, will you hear my suit?
  FIRST LORD. And grant it.
  HELENA. Thanks, sir; all the rest is mute.
  LAFEU. I had rather be in this choice than throw ames-ace for my
    life.
  HELENA. The honour, sir, that flames in your fair eyes,
    Before I speak, too threat'ningly replies.
    Love make your fortunes twenty times above
    Her that so wishes, and her humble love!
  SECOND LORD. No better, if you please.
  HELENA. My wish receive,
    Which great Love grant; and so I take my leave.
  LAFEU. Do all they deny her? An they were sons of mine I'd have
    them whipt; or I would send them to th' Turk to make eunuchs of.
  HELENA. Be not afraid that I your hand should take;
    I'll never do you wrong for your own sake.
    Blessing upon your vows; and in your bed
    Find fairer fortune, if you ever wed!
  LAFEU. These boys are boys of ice; they'll none have her.
    Sure, they are bastards to the English; the French ne'er got 'em.
  HELENA. You are too young, too happy, and too good,
    To make yourself a son out of my blood.
  FOURTH LORD. Fair one, I think not so.
  LAFEU. There's one grape yet; I am sure thy father drunk wine-but
    if thou be'st not an ass, I am a youth of fourteen; I have known
    thee already.
  HELENA.  [To BERTRAM]  I dare not say I take you; but I give
    Me and my service, ever whilst I live,
    Into your guiding power. This is the man.
  KING. Why, then, young Bertram, take her; she's thy wife.
  BERTRAM. My wife, my liege! I shall beseech your Highness,
    In such a business give me leave to use
    The help of mine own eyes.
  KING. Know'st thou not, Bertram,
    What she has done for me?
  BERTRAM. Yes, my good lord;
    But never hope to know why I should marry her.
  KING. Thou know'st she has rais'd me from my sickly bed.
  BERTRAM. But follows it, my lord, to bring me down
    Must answer for your raising? I know her well:
    She had her breeding at my father's charge.
    A poor physician's daughter my wife! Disdain
    Rather corrupt me ever!
  KING. 'Tis only title thou disdain'st in her, the which
    I can build up. Strange is it that our bloods,
    Of colour, weight, and heat, pour'd all together,
    Would quite confound distinction, yet stand off
    In differences so mighty. If she be
    All that is virtuous-save what thou dislik'st,
    A poor physician's daughter-thou dislik'st
    Of virtue for the name; but do not so.
    From lowest place when virtuous things proceed,
    The place is dignified by the doer's deed;
    Where great additions swell's, and virtue none,
    It is a dropsied honour. Good alone
    Is good without a name. Vileness is so:
    The property by what it is should go,
    Not by the title. She is young, wise, fair;
    In these to nature she's immediate heir;
    And these breed honour. That is honour's scorn
    Which challenges itself as honour's born
    And is not like the sire. Honours thrive
    When rather from our acts we them derive
    Than our fore-goers. The mere word's a slave,
    Debauch'd on every tomb, on every grave
    A lying trophy; and as oft is dumb
    Where dust and damn'd oblivion is the tomb
    Of honour'd bones indeed. What should be said?
    If thou canst like this creature as a maid,
    I can create the rest. Virtue and she
    Is her own dower; honour and wealth from me.
  BERTRAM. I cannot love her, nor will strive to do 't.
  KING. Thou wrong'st thyself, if thou shouldst strive to choose.
  HELENA. That you are well restor'd, my lord, I'm glad.
    Let the rest go.
  KING. My honour's at the stake; which to defeat,
    I must produce my power. Here, take her hand,
    Proud scornful boy, unworthy this good gift,
    That dost in vile misprision shackle up
    My love and her desert; that canst not dream
    We, poising us in her defective scale,
    Shall weigh thee to the beam; that wilt not know
    It is in us to plant thine honour where
    We please to have it grow. Check thy contempt;
    Obey our will, which travails in thy good;
    Believe not thy disdain, but presently
    Do thine own fortunes that obedient right
    Which both thy duty owes and our power claims;
    Or I will throw thee from my care for ever
    Into the staggers and the careless lapse
    Of youth and ignorance; both my revenge and hate
    Loosing upon thee in the name of justice,
    Without all terms of pity. Speak; thine answer.
  BERTRAM. Pardon, my gracious lord; for I submit
    My fancy to your eyes. When I consider
    What great creation and what dole of honour
    Flies where you bid it, I find that she which late
    Was in my nobler thoughts most base is now
    The praised of the King; who, so ennobled,
    Is as 'twere born so.
  KING. Take her by the hand,
    And tell her she is thine; to whom I promise
    A counterpoise, if not to thy estate
    A balance more replete.
  BERTRAM. I take her hand.
  KING. Good fortune and the favour of the King
    Smile upon this contract; whose ceremony
    Shall seem expedient on the now-born brief,
    And be perform'd to-night. The solemn feast
    Shall more attend upon the coming space,
    Expecting absent friends. As thou lov'st her,
    Thy love's to me religious; else, does err.
              Exeunt all but LAFEU and PAROLLES who stay behind,
                                      commenting of this wedding
  LAFEU. Do you hear, monsieur? A word with you.
  PAROLLES. Your pleasure, sir?
  LAFEU. Your lord and master did well to make his recantation.
  PAROLLES. Recantation! My Lord! my master!
  LAFEU. Ay; is it not a language I speak?
  PAROLLES. A most harsh one, and not to be understood without bloody
    succeeding. My master!
  LAFEU. Are you companion to the Count Rousillon?
  PAROLLES. To any count; to all counts; to what is man.
  LAFEU. To what is count's man: count's master is of another style.
  PAROLLES. You are too old, sir; let it satisfy you, you are too
    old.
  LAFEU. I must tell thee, sirrah, I write man; to which title age
    cannot bring thee.
  PAROLLES. What I dare too well do, I dare not do.
  LAFEU. I did think thee, for two ordinaries, to be a pretty wise
    fellow; thou didst make tolerable vent of thy travel; it might
    pass. Yet the scarfs and the bannerets about thee did manifoldly
    dissuade me from believing thee a vessel of too great a burden. I
    have now found thee; when I lose thee again I care not; yet art
    thou good for nothing but taking up; and that thou'rt scarce
    worth.
  PAROLLES. Hadst thou not the privilege of antiquity upon thee-
  LAFEU. Do not plunge thyself too far in anger, lest thou hasten thy
    trial; which if-Lord have mercy on thee for a hen! So, my good
    window of lattice, fare thee well; thy casement I need not open,
    for I look through thee. Give me thy hand.
  PAROLLES. My lord, you give me most egregious indignity.
  LAFEU. Ay, with all my heart; and thou art worthy of it.
  PAROLLES. I have not, my lord, deserv'd it.
  LAFEU. Yes, good faith, ev'ry dram of it; and I will not bate thee
    a scruple.
  PAROLLES. Well, I shall be wiser.
  LAFEU. Ev'n as soon as thou canst, for thou hast to pull at a smack
    o' th' contrary. If ever thou be'st bound in thy scarf and
    beaten, thou shalt find what it is to be proud of thy bondage. I
    have a desire to hold my acquaintance with thee, or rather my
    knowledge, that I may say in the default 'He is a man I know.'
  PAROLLES. My lord, you do me most insupportable vexation.
  LAFEU. I would it were hell pains for thy sake, and my poor doing
    eternal; for doing I am past, as I will by thee, in what motion
    age will give me leave.                                 Exit
  PAROLLES. Well, thou hast a son shall take this disgrace off me:
    scurvy, old, filthy, scurvy lord! Well, I must be patient; there
    is no fettering of authority. I'll beat him, by my life, if I can
    meet him with any convenience, an he were double and double a
    lord. I'll have no more pity of his age than I would have of-
    I'll beat him, and if I could but meet him again.

                         Re-enter LAFEU

  LAFEU. Sirrah, your lord and master's married; there's news for
    you; you have a new mistress.
  PAROLLES. I most unfeignedly beseech your lordship to make some
    reservation of your wrongs. He is my good lord: whom I serve
    above is my master.
  LAFEU. Who? God?
  PAROLLES. Ay, sir.
  LAFEU. The devil it is that's thy master. Why dost thou garter up
    thy arms o' this fashion? Dost make hose of thy sleeves? Do other
    servants so? Thou wert best set thy lower part where thy nose
    stands. By mine honour, if I were but two hours younger, I'd beat
    thee. Methink'st thou art a general offence, and every man should
    beat thee. I think thou wast created for men to breathe
    themselves upon thee.
  PAROLLES. This is hard and undeserved measure, my lord.
  LAFEU. Go to, sir; you were beaten in Italy for picking a kernel
    out of a pomegranate; you are a vagabond, and no true traveller;
    you are more saucy with lords and honourable personages than the
    commission of your birth and virtue gives you heraldry. You are
    not worth another word, else I'd call you knave. I leave you.
 Exit

                           Enter BERTRAM

  PAROLLES. Good, very, good, it is so then. Good, very good; let it
    be conceal'd awhile.
  BERTRAM. Undone, and forfeited to cares for ever!
  PAROLLES. What's the matter, sweetheart?
  BERTRAM. Although before the solemn priest I have sworn,
    I will not bed her.
  PAROLLES. What, what, sweetheart?
  BERTRAM. O my Parolles, they have married me!
    I'll to the Tuscan wars, and never bed her.
  PAROLLES. France is a dog-hole, and it no more merits
    The tread of a man's foot. To th' wars!
  BERTRAM. There's letters from my mother; what th' import is I know
    not yet.
  PAROLLES. Ay, that would be known. To th' wars, my boy, to th'
      wars!
    He wears his honour in a box unseen
    That hugs his kicky-wicky here at home,
    Spending his manly marrow in her arms,
    Which should sustain the bound and high curvet
    Of Mars's fiery steed. To other regions!
    France is a stable; we that dwell in't jades;
    Therefore, to th' war!
  BERTRAM. It shall be so; I'll send her to my house,
    Acquaint my mother with my hate to her,
    And wherefore I am fled; write to the King
    That which I durst not speak. His present gift
    Shall furnish me to those Italian fields
    Where noble fellows strike. War is no strife
    To the dark house and the detested wife.
  PAROLLES. Will this capriccio hold in thee, art sure?
  BERTRAM. Go with me to my chamber and advise me.
    I'll send her straight away. To-morrow
    I'll to the wars, she to her single sorrow.
  PAROLLES. Why, these balls bound; there's noise in it. 'Tis hard:
    A young man married is a man that's marr'd.
    Therefore away, and leave her bravely; go.
    The King has done you wrong; but, hush, 'tis so.      Exeunt

Paris. The KING'S palace

Enter HELENA and CLOWN

  HELENA. My mother greets me kindly; is she well?
  CLOWN. She is not well, but yet she has her health; she's very
    merry, but yet she is not well. But thanks be given, she's very
    well, and wants nothing i' th' world; but yet she is not well.
  HELENA. If she be very well, what does she ail that she's not very
    well?
  CLOWN. Truly, she's very well indeed, but for two things.
  HELENA. What two things?
  CLOWN. One, that she's not in heaven, whither God send her quickly!
    The other, that she's in earth, from whence God send her quickly!

                        Enter PAROLLES

  PAROLLES. Bless you, my fortunate lady!
  HELENA. I hope, sir, I have your good will to have mine own good
    fortunes.
  PAROLLES. You had my prayers to lead them on; and to keep them on,
    have them still. O, my knave, how does my old lady?
  CLOWN. So that you had her wrinkles and I her money, I would she
    did as you say.
  PAROLLES. Why, I say nothing.
  CLOWN. Marry, you are the wiser man; for many a man's tongue shakes
    out his master's undoing. To say nothing, to do nothing, to know
    nothing, and to have nothing, is to be a great part of your
    title, which is within a very little of nothing.
  PAROLLES. Away! th'art a knave.
  CLOWN. You should have said, sir, 'Before a knave th'art a knave';
    that's 'Before me th'art a knave.' This had been truth, sir.
  PAROLLES. Go to, thou art a witty fool; I have found thee.
  CLOWN. Did you find me in yourself, sir, or were you taught to find
    me? The search, sir, was profitable; and much fool may you find
    in you, even to the world's pleasure and the increase of
    laughter.
  PAROLLES. A good knave, i' faith, and well fed.
    Madam, my lord will go away to-night:
    A very serious business calls on him.
    The great prerogative and rite of love,
    Which, as your due, time claims, he does acknowledge;
    But puts it off to a compell'd restraint;
    Whose want, and whose delay, is strew'd with sweets,
    Which they distil now in the curbed time,
    To make the coming hour o'erflow with joy
    And pleasure drown the brim.
  HELENA. What's his else?
  PAROLLES. That you will take your instant leave o' th' King,
    And make this haste as your own good proceeding,
    Strength'ned with what apology you think
    May make it probable need.
  HELENA. What more commands he?
  PAROLLES. That, having this obtain'd, you presently
    Attend his further pleasure.
  HELENA. In everything I wait upon his will.
  PAROLLES. I shall report it so.
  HELENA. I pray you.                              Exit PAROLLES
    Come, sirrah.                                         Exeunt




ACT II. SCENE 5.
Paris. The KING'S palace

Enter LAFEU and BERTRAM

  LAFEU. But I hope your lordship thinks not him a soldier.
  BERTRAM. Yes, my lord, and of very valiant approof.
  LAFEU. You have it from his own deliverance.
  BERTRAM. And by other warranted testimony.
  LAFEU. Then my dial goes not true; I took this lark for a bunting.
  BERTRAM. I do assure you, my lord, he is very great in knowledge,
    and accordingly valiant.
  LAFEU. I have then sinn'd against his experience and transgress'd
    against his valour; and my state that way is dangerous, since I
    cannot yet find in my heart to repent. Here he comes; I pray you
    make us friends; I will pursue the amity

                         Enter PAROLLES

  PAROLLES.  [To BERTRAM]  These things shall be done, sir.
  LAFEU. Pray you, sir, who's his tailor?
  PAROLLES. Sir!
  LAFEU. O, I know him well. Ay, sir; he, sir, 's a good workman, a
    very good tailor.
  BERTRAM.  [Aside to PAROLLES]  Is she gone to the King?
  PAROLLES. She is.
  BERTRAM. Will she away to-night?
  PAROLLES. As you'll have her.
  BERTRAM. I have writ my letters, casketed my treasure,
    Given order for our horses; and to-night,
    When I should take possession of the bride,
    End ere I do begin.
  LAFEU. A good traveller is something at the latter end of a dinner;
    but one that lies three-thirds and uses a known truth to pass a
    thousand nothings with, should be once heard and thrice beaten.
    God save you, Captain.
  BERTRAM. Is there any unkindness between my lord and you, monsieur?
  PAROLLES. I know not how I have deserved to run into my lord's
    displeasure.
  LAFEU. You have made shift to run into 't, boots and spurs and all,
    like him that leapt into the custard; and out of it you'll run
    again, rather than suffer question for your residence.
  BERTRAM. It may be you have mistaken him, my lord.
  LAFEU. And shall do so ever, though I took him at's prayers.
    Fare you well, my lord; and believe this of me: there can be no
    kernal in this light nut; the soul of this man is his clothes;
    trust him not in matter of heavy consequence; I have kept of them
    tame, and know their natures. Farewell, monsieur; I have spoken
    better of you than you have or will to deserve at my hand; but we
    must do good against evil.                              Exit
  PAROLLES. An idle lord, I swear.
  BERTRAM. I think so.
  PAROLLES. Why, do you not know him?
  BERTRAM. Yes, I do know him well; and common speech
    Gives him a worthy pass. Here comes my clog.

                          Enter HELENA

  HELENA. I have, sir, as I was commanded from you,
    Spoke with the King, and have procur'd his leave
    For present parting; only he desires
    Some private speech with you.
  BERTRAM. I shall obey his will.
    You must not marvel, Helen, at my course,
    Which holds not colour with the time, nor does
    The ministration and required office
    On my particular. Prepar'd I was not
    For such a business; therefore am I found
    So much unsettled. This drives me to entreat you
    That presently you take your way for home,
    And rather muse than ask why I entreat you;
    For my respects are better than they seem,
    And my appointments have in them a need
    Greater than shows itself at the first view
    To you that know them not. This to my mother.
                                               [Giving a letter]
    'Twill be two days ere I shall see you; so
    I leave you to your wisdom.
  HELENA. Sir, I can nothing say
    But that I am your most obedient servant.
  BERTRAM. Come, come, no more of that.
  HELENA. And ever shall
    With true observance seek to eke out that
    Wherein toward me my homely stars have fail'd
    To equal my great fortune.
  BERTRAM. Let that go.
    My haste is very great. Farewell; hie home.
  HELENA. Pray, sir, your pardon.
  BERTRAM. Well, what would you say?
  HELENA. I am not worthy of the wealth I owe,
    Nor dare I say 'tis mine, and yet it is;
    But, like a timorous thief, most fain would steal
    What law does vouch mine own.
  BERTRAM. What would you have?
  HELENA. Something; and scarce so much; nothing, indeed.
    I would not tell you what I would, my lord.
    Faith, yes:
    Strangers and foes do sunder and not kiss.
  BERTRAM. I pray you, stay not, but in haste to horse.
  HELENA. I shall not break your bidding, good my lord.
  BERTRAM. Where are my other men, monsieur?
    Farewell!                                        Exit HELENA
    Go thou toward home, where I will never come
    Whilst I can shake my sword or hear the drum.
    Away, and for our flight.
  PAROLLES. Bravely, coragio!                             Exeunt

ACT III. SCENE 1.
Florence. The DUKE's palace

        Flourish. Enter the DUKE OF FLORENCE, attended; two
               FRENCH LORDS, with a TROOP OF SOLDIERS

  DUKE. So that, from point to point, now have you hear
    The fundamental reasons of this war;
    Whose great decision hath much blood let forth
    And more thirsts after.
  FIRST LORD. Holy seems the quarrel
    Upon your Grace's part; black and fearful
    On the opposer.
  DUKE. Therefore we marvel much our cousin France
    Would in so just a business shut his bosom
    Against our borrowing prayers.
  SECOND LORD. Good my lord,
    The reasons of our state I cannot yield,
    But like a common and an outward man
    That the great figure of a council frames
    By self-unable motion; therefore dare not
    Say what I think of it, since I have found
    Myself in my incertain grounds to fail
    As often as I guess'd.
  DUKE. Be it his pleasure.
  FIRST LORD. But I am sure the younger of our nature,
    That surfeit on their ease, will day by day
    Come here for physic.
  DUKE. Welcome shall they be
    And all the honours that can fly from us
    Shall on them settle. You know your places well;
    When better fall, for your avails they fell.
    To-morrow to th' field. Flourish.                     Exeunt




ACT III. SCENE 2.
Rousillon. The COUNT'S palace

Enter COUNTESS and CLOWN

  COUNTESS. It hath happen'd all as I would have had it, save that he
    comes not along with her.
  CLOWN. By my troth, I take my young lord to be a very melancholy
    man.
  COUNTESS. By what observance, I pray you?
  CLOWN. Why, he will look upon his boot and sing; mend the ruff and
    sing; ask questions and sing; pick his teeth and sing. I know a
    man that had this trick of melancholy sold a goodly manor for a
    song.
  COUNTESS. Let me see what he writes, and when he means to come.
                                              [Opening a letter]
  CLOWN. I have no mind to Isbel since I was at court. Our old ling
    and our Isbels o' th' country are nothing like your old ling and
    your Isbels o' th' court. The brains of my Cupid's knock'd out;
    and I begin to love, as an old man loves money, with no stomach.
  COUNTESS. What have we here?
  CLOWN. E'en that you have there.                          Exit
  COUNTESS.  [Reads]  'I have sent you a daughter-in-law; she hath
    recovered the King and undone me. I have wedded her, not bedded
    her; and sworn to make the "not" eternal. You shall hear I am run
    away; know it before the report come. If there be breadth enough
    in the world, I will hold a long distance. My duty to you.
                                           Your unfortunate son,
                                                       BERTRAM.'
    This is not well, rash and unbridled boy,
    To fly the favours of so good a king,
    To pluck his indignation on thy head
    By the misprizing of a maid too virtuous
    For the contempt of empire.

                           Re-enter CLOWN

  CLOWN. O madam, yonder is heavy news within between two soldiers
    and my young lady.
  COUNTESS. What is the -matter?
  CLOWN. Nay, there is some comfort in the news, some comfort; your
    son will not be kill'd so soon as I thought he would.
  COUNTESS. Why should he be kill'd?
  CLOWN. So say I, madam, if he run away, as I hear he does the
    danger is in standing to 't; that's the loss of men, though it be
    the getting of children. Here they come will tell you more. For my
    part, I only hear your son was run away.                Exit

              Enter HELENA and the two FRENCH GENTLEMEN

  SECOND GENTLEMAN. Save you, good madam.
  HELENA. Madam, my lord is gone, for ever gone.
  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Do not say so.
  COUNTESS. Think upon patience. Pray you, gentlemen-
    I have felt so many quirks of joy and grief
    That the first face of neither, on the start,
    Can woman me unto 't. Where is my son, I pray you?
  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Madam, he's gone to serve the Duke of Florence.
    We met him thitherward; for thence we came,
    And, after some dispatch in hand at court,
    Thither we bend again.
  HELENA. Look on this letter, madam; here's my passport.
    [Reads]  'When thou canst get the ring upon my finger, which
    never shall come off, and show me a child begotten of thy body
    that I am father to, then call me husband; but in such a "then" I
    write a "never."
    This is a dreadful sentence.
  COUNTESS. Brought you this letter, gentlemen?
  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Ay, madam;
    And for the contents' sake are sorry for our pains.
  COUNTESS. I prithee, lady, have a better cheer;
    If thou engrossest all the griefs are thine,
    Thou robb'st me of a moiety. He was my son;
    But I do wash his name out of my blood,
    And thou art all my child. Towards Florence is he?
  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Ay, madam.
  COUNTESS. And to be a soldier?
  FIRST GENTLEMAN. Such is his noble purpose; and, believe 't,
    The Duke will lay upon him all the honour
    That good convenience claims.
  COUNTESS. Return you thither?
  SECOND GENTLEMAN. Ay, madam, with the swiftest wing of speed.
  HELENA.  [Reads]  'Till I have no wife, I have nothing in France.'
    'Tis bitter.
  COUNTESS. Find you that there?
  HELENA. Ay, madam.
  SECOND GENTLEMAN. 'Tis but the boldness of his hand haply, which
    his heart was not consenting to.
  COUNTESS. Nothing in France until he have no wife!
    There's nothing here that is too good for him
    But only she; and she deserves a lord
    That twenty such rude boys might tend upon,
    And call her hourly mistress. Who was with him?
  SECOND GENTLEMAN. A servant only, and a gentleman
    Which I have sometime known.
  COUNTESS. Parolles, was it not?
  SECOND GENTLEMAN. Ay, my good lady, he.
  COUNTESS. A very tainted fellow, and full of wickedness.
    My son corrupts a well-derived nature
    With his inducement.
  SECOND GENTLEMAN. Indeed, good lady,
    The fellow has a deal of that too much
    Which holds him much to have.
  COUNTESS. Y'are welcome, gentlemen.
    I will entreat you, when you see my son,
    To tell him that his sword can never win
    The honour that he loses. More I'll entreat you
    Written to bear along.
  FIRST GENTLEMAN. We serve you, madam,
    In that and all your worthiest affairs.
  COUNTESS. Not so, but as we change our courtesies.
    Will you draw near?            Exeunt COUNTESS and GENTLEMEN
  HELENA. 'Till I have no wife, I have nothing in France.'
    Nothing in France until he has no wife!
    Thou shalt have none, Rousillon, none in France
    Then hast thou all again. Poor lord! is't
    That chase thee from thy country, and expose
    Those tender limbs of thine to the event
    Of the non-sparing war? And is it I
    That drive thee from the sportive court, where thou
    Wast shot at with fair eyes, to be the mark
    Of smoky muskets? O you leaden messengers,
    That ride upon the violent speed of fire,
    Fly with false aim; move the still-piecing air,
    That sings with piercing; do not touch my lord.
    Whoever shoots at him, I set him there;
    Whoever charges on his forward breast,
    I am the caitiff that do hold him to't;
    And though I kill him not, I am the cause
    His death was so effected. Better 'twere
    I met the ravin lion when he roar'd
    With sharp constraint of hunger; better 'twere
    That all the miseries which nature owes
    Were mine at once. No; come thou home, Rousillon,
    Whence honour but of danger wins a scar,
    As oft it loses all. I will be gone.
    My being here it is that holds thee hence.
    Shall I stay here to do 't? No, no, although
    The air of paradise did fan the house,
    And angels offic'd all. I will be gone,
    That pitiful rumour may report my flight
    To consolate thine ear. Come, night; end, day.
    For with the dark, poor thief, I'll steal away.         Exit




ACT III. SCENE 3.
Florence. Before the DUKE's palace

Flourish. Enter the DUKE OF FLORENCE, BERTRAM, PAROLLES, SOLDIERS,
drum and trumpets

  DUKE. The General of our Horse thou art; and we,
    Great in our hope, lay our best love and credence
    Upon thy promising fortune.
  BERTRAM. Sir, it is
    A charge too heavy for my strength; but yet
    We'll strive to bear it for your worthy sake
    To th' extreme edge of hazard.
  DUKE. Then go thou forth;
    And Fortune play upon thy prosperous helm,
    As thy auspicious mistress!
  BERTRAM. This very day,
    Great Mars, I put myself into thy file;
    Make me but like my thoughts, and I shall prove
    A lover of thy drum, hater of love.                   Exeunt




ACT III. SCENE 4.
Rousillon. The COUNT'S palace

Enter COUNTESS and STEWARD

  COUNTESS. Alas! and would you take the letter of her?
    Might you not know she would do as she has done
    By sending me a letter? Read it again.
  STEWARD.  [Reads]  'I am Saint Jaques' pilgrim, thither gone.
    Ambitious love hath so in me offended
    That barefoot plod I the cold ground upon,
    With sainted vow my faults to have amended.
    Write, write, that from the bloody course of war
    My dearest master, your dear son, may hie.
    Bless him at home in peace, whilst I from far
    His name with zealous fervour sanctify.
    His taken labours bid him me forgive;
    I, his despiteful Juno, sent him forth
    From courtly friends, with camping foes to live,
    Where death and danger dogs the heels of worth.
    He is too good and fair for death and me;
    Whom I myself embrace to set him free.'
  COUNTESS. Ah, what sharp stings are in her mildest words!
    Rinaldo, you did never lack advice so much
    As letting her pass so; had I spoke with her,
    I could have well diverted her intents,
    Which thus she hath prevented.
  STEWARD. Pardon me, madam;
    If I had given you this at over-night,
    She might have been o'er ta'en; and yet she writes
    Pursuit would be but vain.
  COUNTESS. What angel shall
    Bless this unworthy husband? He cannot thrive,
    Unless her prayers, whom heaven delights to hear
    And loves to grant, reprieve him from the wrath
    Of greatest justice. Write, write, Rinaldo,
    To this unworthy husband of his wife;
    Let every word weigh heavy of her worth
    That he does weigh too light. My greatest grief,
    Though little he do feel it, set down sharply.
    Dispatch the most convenient messenger.
    When haply he shall hear that she is gone
    He will return; and hope I may that she,
    Hearing so much, will speed her foot again,
    Led hither by pure love. Which of them both
    Is dearest to me I have no skill in sense
    To make distinction. Provide this messenger.
    My heart is heavy, and mine age is weak;
    Grief would have tears, and sorrow bids me speak.     Exeunt




ACT III. SCENE 5.

Without the walls of Florence
A tucket afar off. Enter an old WIDOW OF FLORENCE, her daughter DIANA,
VIOLENTA, and MARIANA, with other CITIZENS

  WIDOW. Nay, come; for if they do approach the city we shall lose
    all the sight.
  DIANA. They say the French count has done most honourable service.
  WIDOW. It is reported that he has taken their great'st commander;
    and that with his own hand he slew the Duke's brother.  [Tucket]
    We have lost our labour; they are gone a contrary way. Hark! you
    may know by their trumpets.
  MARIANA. Come, let's return again, and suffice ourselves with the
    report of it. Well, Diana, take heed of this French earl; the
    honour of a maid is her name, and no legacy is so rich as
    honesty.
  WIDOW. I have told my neighbour how you have been solicited by a
    gentleman his companion.
  MARIANA. I know that knave, hang him! one Parolles; a filthy
    officer he is in those suggestions for the young earl. Beware of
    them, Diana: their promises, enticements, oaths, tokens, and all
    these engines of lust, are not the things they go under; many a
    maid hath been seduced by them; and the misery is, example, that
    so terrible shows in the wreck of maidenhood, cannot for all that
    dissuade succession, but that they are limed with the twigs that
    threatens them. I hope I need not to advise you further; but I
    hope your own grace will keep you where you are, though there
    were no further danger known but the modesty which is so lost.
  DIANA. You shall not need to fear me.

            Enter HELENA in the dress of a pilgrim

  WIDOW. I hope so. Look, here comes a pilgrim. I know she will lie
    at my house: thither they send one another. I'll question her.
    God save you, pilgrim! Whither are bound?
  HELENA. To Saint Jaques le Grand.
    Where do the palmers lodge, I do beseech you?
  WIDOW. At the Saint Francis here, beside the port.
  HELENA. Is this the way?
                                                  [A march afar]
  WIDOW. Ay, marry, is't. Hark you! They come this way.
    If you will tarry, holy pilgrim,
    But till the troops come by,
    I will conduct you where you shall be lodg'd;
    The rather for I think I know your hostess
    As ample as myself.
  HELENA. Is it yourself?
  WIDOW. If you shall please so, pilgrim.
  HELENA. I thank you, and will stay upon your leisure.
  WIDOW. You came, I think, from France?
  HELENA. I did so.
  WIDOW. Here you shall see a countryman of yours
    That has done worthy service.
  HELENA. His name, I pray you.
  DIANA. The Count Rousillon. Know you such a one?
  HELENA. But by the ear, that hears most nobly of him;
    His face I know not.
  DIANA. What some'er he is,
    He's bravely taken here. He stole from France,
    As 'tis reported, for the King had married him
    Against his liking. Think you it is so?
  HELENA. Ay, surely, mere the truth; I know his lady.
  DIANA. There is a gentleman that serves the Count
    Reports but coarsely of her.
  HELENA. What's his name?
  DIANA. Monsieur Parolles.
  HELENA. O, I believe with him,
    In argument of praise, or to the worth
    Of the great Count himself, she is too mean
    To have her name repeated; all her deserving
    Is a reserved honesty, and that
    I have not heard examin'd.
  DIANA. Alas, poor lady!
    'Tis a hard bondage to become the wife
    Of a detesting lord.
  WIDOW. I sweet, good creature, wheresoe'er she is
    Her heart weighs sadly. This young maid might do her
    A shrewd turn, if she pleas'd.
  HELENA. How do you mean?
    May be the amorous Count solicits her
    In the unlawful purpose.
  WIDOW. He does, indeed;
    And brokes with all that can in such a suit
    Corrupt the tender honour of a maid;
    But she is arm'd for him, and keeps her guard
    In honestest defence.

    Enter, with drum and colours, BERTRAM, PAROLLES, and the
                          whole ARMY

  MARIANA. The gods forbid else!
  WIDOW. So, now they come.
    That is Antonio, the Duke's eldest son;
    That, Escalus.
  HELENA. Which is the Frenchman?
  DIANA. He-
    That with the plume; 'tis a most gallant fellow.
    I would he lov'd his wife; if he were honester
    He were much goodlier. Is't not a handsome gentleman?
  HELENA. I like him well.
  DIANA. 'Tis pity he is not honest. Yond's that same knave
    That leads him to these places; were I his lady
    I would poison that vile rascal.
  HELENA. Which is he?
  DIANA. That jack-an-apes with scarfs. Why is he melancholy?
  HELENA. Perchance he's hurt i' th' battle.
  PAROLLES. Lose our drum! well.
  MARIANA. He's shrewdly vex'd at something.
    Look, he has spied us.
  WIDOW. Marry, hang you!
  MARIANA. And your courtesy, for a ring-carrier!
                              Exeunt BERTRAM, PAROLLES, and ARMY
  WIDOW. The troop is past. Come, pilgrim, I will bring you
    Where you shall host. Of enjoin'd penitents
    There's four or five, to great Saint Jaques bound,
    Already at my house.
  HELENA. I humbly thank you.
    Please it this matron and this gentle maid
    To eat with us to-night; the charge and thanking
    Shall be for me, and, to requite you further,
    I will bestow some precepts of this virgin,
    Worthy the note.
    BOTH. We'll take your offer kindly.                   Exeunt




ACT III. SCENE 6.
Camp before Florence

Enter BERTRAM, and the two FRENCH LORDS

  SECOND LORD. Nay, good my lord, put him to't; let him have his way.
  FIRST LORD. If your lordship find him not a hiding, hold me no more
    in your respect.
  SECOND LORD. On my life, my lord, a bubble.
  BERTRAM. Do you think I am so far deceived in him?
  SECOND LORD. Believe it, my lord, in mine own direct knowledge,
    without any malice, but to speak of him as my kinsman, he's a
    most notable coward, an infinite and endless liar, an hourly
    promise-breaker, the owner of no one good quality worthy your
    lordship's entertainment.
  FIRST LORD. It were fit you knew him; lest, reposing too far in his
    virtue, which he hath not, he might at some great and trusty
    business in a main danger fail you.
  BERTRAM. I would I knew in what particular action to try him.
  FIRST LORD. None better than to let him fetch off his drum, which
    you hear him so confidently undertake to do.
  SECOND LORD. I with a troop of Florentines will suddenly surprise
    him; such I will have whom I am sure he knows not from the enemy.
    We will bind and hoodwink him so that he shall suppose no other
    but that he is carried into the leaguer of the adversaries when
    we bring him to our own tents. Be but your lordship present at
    his examination; if he do not, for the promise of his life and in
    the highest compulsion of base fear, offer to betray you and
    deliver all the intelligence in his power against you, and that
    with the divine forfeit of his soul upon oath, never trust my
    judgment in anything.
  FIRST LORD. O, for the love of laughter, let him fetch his drum; he
    says he has a stratagem for't. When your lordship sees the bottom
    of his success in't, and to what metal this counterfeit lump of
    ore will be melted, if you give him not John Drum's
    entertainment, your inclining cannot be removed. Here he comes.

                      Enter PAROLLES

  SECOND LORD. O, for the love of laughter, hinder not the honour of
    his design; let him fetch off his drum in any hand.
  BERTRAM. How now, monsieur! This drum sticks sorely in your
    disposition.
  FIRST LORD. A pox on 't; let it go; 'tis but a drum.
  PAROLLES. But a drum! Is't but a drum? A drum so lost! There was
    excellent command: to charge in with our horse upon our own
    wings, and to rend our own soldiers!
  FIRST LORD. That was not to be blam'd in the command of the
    service; it was a disaster of war that Caesar himself could not
    have prevented, if he had been there to command.
  BERTRAM. Well, we cannot greatly condemn our success.
    Some dishonour we had in the loss of that drum; but it is not to
    be recovered.
  PAROLLES. It might have been recovered.
  BERTRAM. It might, but it is not now.
  PAROLLES. It is to be recovered. But that the merit of service is
    seldom attributed to the true and exact performer, I would have
    that drum or another, or 'hic jacet.'
  BERTRAM. Why, if you have a stomach, to't, monsieur. If you think
    your mystery in stratagem can bring this instrument of honour
    again into his native quarter, be magnanimous in the enterprise,
    and go on; I will grace the attempt for a worthy exploit. If you
    speed well in it, the Duke shall both speak of it and extend to
    you what further becomes his greatness, even to the utmost
    syllable of our worthiness.
  PAROLLES. By the hand of a soldier, I will undertake it.
  BERTRAM. But you must not now slumber in it.
  PAROLLES. I'll about it this evening; and I will presently pen
    down my dilemmas, encourage myself in my certainty, put myself
    into my mortal preparation; and by midnight look to hear further
    from me.
  BERTRAM. May I be bold to acquaint his Grace you are gone about it?
  PAROLLES. I know not what the success will be, my lord, but the
    attempt I vow.
  BERTRAM. I know th' art valiant; and, to the of thy soldiership,
    will subscribe for thee. Farewell.
  PAROLLES. I love not many words.                          Exit
  SECOND LORD. No more than a fish loves water. Is not this a strange
    fellow, my lord, that so confidently seems to undertake this
    business, which he knows is not to be done; damns himself to do,
    and dares better be damn'd than to do 't.
  FIRST LORD. You do not know him, my lord, as we do. Certain it is
    that he will steal himself into a man's favour, and for a week
    escape a great deal of discoveries; but when you find him out,
    you have him ever after.
  BERTRAM. Why, do you think he will make no deed at all of this that
    so seriously he does address himself unto?
  SECOND LORD. None in the world; but return with an invention, and
    clap upon you two or three probable lies. But we have almost
    emboss'd him. You shall see his fall to-night; for indeed he is
    not for your lordship's respect.
  FIRST LORD. We'll make you some sport with the fox ere we case him.
    He was first smok'd by the old Lord Lafeu. When his disguise and
    he is parted, tell me what a sprat you shall find him; which you
    shall see this very night.
  SECOND LORD. I must go look my twigs; he shall be caught.
  BERTRAM. Your brother, he shall go along with me.
  SECOND LORD. As't please your lordship. I'll leave you.   Exit
  BERTRAM. Now will I lead you to the house, and show you
    The lass I spoke of.
  FIRST LORD. But you say she's honest.
  BERTRAM. That's all the fault. I spoke with her but once,
    And found her wondrous cold; but I sent to her,
    By this same coxcomb that we have i' th' wind,
    Tokens and letters which she did re-send;
    And this is all I have done. She's a fair creature;
    Will you go see her?
  FIRST LORD. With all my heart, my lord.                 Exeunt




ACT III. SCENE 7.
Florence. The WIDOW'S house

Enter HELENA and WIDOW

  HELENA. If you misdoubt me that I am not she,
    I know not how I shall assure you further
    But I shall lose the grounds I work upon.
  WIDOW. Though my estate be fall'n, I was well born,
    Nothing acquainted with these businesses;
    And would not put my reputation now
    In any staining act.
  HELENA. Nor would I wish you.
  FIRST give me trust the Count he is my husband,
    And what to your sworn counsel I have spoken
    Is so from word to word; and then you cannot,
    By the good aid that I of you shall borrow,
    Err in bestowing it.
  WIDOW. I should believe you;
    For you have show'd me that which well approves
    Y'are great in fortune.
  HELENA. Take this purse of gold,
    And let me buy your friendly help thus far,
    Which I will over-pay and pay again
    When I have found it. The Count he woos your daughter
    Lays down his wanton siege before her beauty,
    Resolv'd to carry her. Let her in fine consent,
    As we'll direct her how 'tis best to bear it.
    Now his important blood will nought deny
    That she'll demand. A ring the County wears
    That downward hath succeeded in his house
    From son to son some four or five descents
    Since the first father wore it. This ring he holds
    In most rich choice; yet, in his idle fire,
    To buy his will, it would not seem too dear,
    Howe'er repented after.
  WIDOW. Now I see
    The bottom of your purpose.
  HELENA. You see it lawful then. It is no more
    But that your daughter, ere she seems as won,
    Desires this ring; appoints him an encounter;
    In fine, delivers me to fill the time,
    Herself most chastely absent. After this,
    To marry her, I'll add three thousand crowns
    To what is pass'd already.
  WIDOW. I have yielded.
    Instruct my daughter how she shall persever,
    That time and place with this deceit so lawful
    May prove coherent. Every night he comes
    With musics of all sorts, and songs compos'd
    To her unworthiness. It nothing steads us
    To chide him from our eaves, for he persists
    As if his life lay on 't.
  HELENA. Why then to-night
    Let us assay our plot; which, if it speed,
    Is wicked meaning in a lawful deed,
    And lawful meaning in a lawful act;
    Where both not sin, and yet a sinful fact.
    But let's about it.                                   Exeunt

ACT IV. SCENE 1.
Without the Florentine camp

Enter SECOND FRENCH LORD with five or six other SOLDIERS in ambush

  SECOND LORD. He can come no other way but by this hedge-corner.
    When you sally upon him, speak what terrible language you will;
    though you understand it not yourselves, no matter; for we must
    not seem to understand him, unless some one among us, whom we
    must produce for an interpreter.
  FIRST SOLDIER. Good captain, let me be th' interpreter.
  SECOND LORD. Art not acquainted with him? Knows he not thy voice?
  FIRST SOLDIER. No, sir, I warrant you.
  SECOND LORD. But what linsey-woolsey has thou to speak to us again?
  FIRST SOLDIER. E'en such as you speak to me.
  SECOND LORD. He must think us some band of strangers i' th'
    adversary's entertainment. Now he hath a smack of all
    neighbouring languages, therefore we must every one be a man of
    his own fancy; not to know what we speak one to another, so we
    seem to know, is to know straight our purpose: choughs' language,
    gabble enough, and good enough. As for you, interpreter, you must
    seem very politic. But couch, ho! here he comes; to beguile two
    hours in a sleep, and then to return and swear the lies he forges.

                         Enter PAROLLES

  PAROLLES. Ten o'clock. Within these three hours 'twill be time
    enough to go home. What shall I say I have done? It must be a
    very plausive invention that carries it. They begin to smoke me;
    and disgraces have of late knock'd to often at my door. I find my
    tongue is too foolhardy; but my heart hath the fear of Mars
    before it, and of his creatures, not daring the reports of my
    tongue.
  SECOND LORD. This is the first truth that e'er thine own tongue was
    guilty of.
  PAROLLES. What the devil should move me to undertake the recovery
    of this drum, being not ignorant of the impossibility, and
    knowing I had no such purpose? I must give myself some hurts, and
    say I got them in exploit. Yet slight ones will not carry it.
    They will say 'Came you off with so little?' And great ones I
    dare not give. Wherefore, what's the instance? Tongue, I must put
    you into a butterwoman's mouth, and buy myself another of
    Bajazet's mule, if you prattle me into these perils.
  SECOND LORD. Is it possible he should know what he is, and be that
    he is?
  PAROLLES. I would the cutting of my garments would serve the turn,
    or the breaking of my Spanish sword.
  SECOND LORD. We cannot afford you so.
  PAROLLES. Or the baring of my beard; and to say it was in
    stratagem.
  SECOND LORD. 'Twould not do.
  PAROLLES. Or to drown my clothes, and say I was stripp'd.
  SECOND LORD. Hardly serve.
  PAROLLES. Though I swore I leap'd from the window of the citadel-
  SECOND LORD. How deep?
  PAROLLES. Thirty fathom.
  SECOND LORD. Three great oaths would scarce make that be believed.
  PAROLLES. I would I had any drum of the enemy's; I would swear I
    recover'd it.
  SECOND LORD. You shall hear one anon.          [Alarum within]
  PAROLLES. A drum now of the enemy's!
  SECOND LORD. Throca movousus, cargo, cargo, cargo.
  ALL. Cargo, cargo, cargo, villianda par corbo, cargo.
  PAROLLES. O, ransom, ransom! Do not hide mine eyes.
                                            [They blindfold him]
  FIRST SOLDIER. Boskos thromuldo boskos.
  PAROLLES. I know you are the Muskos' regiment,
    And I shall lose my life for want of language.
    If there be here German, or Dane, Low Dutch,
    Italian, or French, let him speak to me;
    I'll discover that which shall undo the Florentine.
  FIRST SOLDIER. Boskos vauvado. I understand thee, and can speak thy
    tongue. Kerely-bonto, sir, betake thee to thy faith, for
    seventeen poniards are at thy bosom.
  PAROLLES. O!
  FIRST SOLDIER. O, pray, pray, pray! Manka revania dulche.
  SECOND LORD. Oscorbidulchos volivorco.
  FIRST SOLDIER. The General is content to spare thee yet;
    And, hoodwink'd as thou art, will lead thee on
    To gather from thee. Haply thou mayst inform
    Something to save thy life.
  PAROLLES. O, let me live,
    And all the secrets of our camp I'll show,
    Their force, their purposes. Nay, I'll speak that
    Which you will wonder at.
  FIRST SOLDIER. But wilt thou faithfully?
  PAROLLES. If I do not, damn me.
  FIRST SOLDIER. Acordo linta.
    Come on; thou art granted space.
                   Exit, PAROLLES guarded. A short alarum within
  SECOND LORD. Go, tell the Count Rousillon and my brother
    We have caught the woodcock, and will keep him muffled
    Till we do hear from them.
  SECOND SOLDIER. Captain, I will.
  SECOND LORD. 'A will betray us all unto ourselves-
    Inform on that.
  SECOND SOLDIER. So I will, sir.
  SECOND LORD. Till then I'll keep him dark and safely lock'd.
                                                          Exeunt




ACT IV. SCENE 2.
Florence. The WIDOW'S house

Enter BERTRAM and DIANA

  BERTRAM. They told me that your name was Fontibell.
  DIANA. No, my good lord, Diana.
  BERTRAM. Titled goddess;
    And worth it, with addition! But, fair soul,
    In your fine frame hath love no quality?
    If the quick fire of youth light not your mind,
    You are no maiden, but a monument;
    When you are dead, you should be such a one
    As you are now, for you are cold and stern;
    And now you should be as your mother was
    When your sweet self was got.
  DIANA. She then was honest.
  BERTRAM. So should you be.
  DIANA. No.
    My mother did but duty; such, my lord,
    As you owe to your wife.
  BERTRAM. No more o'that!
    I prithee do not strive against my vows.
    I was compell'd to her; but I love the
    By love's own sweet constraint, and will for ever
    Do thee all rights of service.
  DIANA. Ay, so you serve us
    Till we serve you; but when you have our roses
    You barely leave our thorns to prick ourselves,
    And mock us with our bareness.
  BERTRAM. How have I sworn!
  DIANA. 'Tis not the many oaths that makes the truth,
    But the plain single vow that is vow'd true.
    What is not holy, that we swear not by,
    But take the High'st to witness. Then, pray you, tell me:
    If I should swear by Jove's great attributes
    I lov'd you dearly, would you believe my oaths
    When I did love you ill? This has no holding,
    To swear by him whom I protest to love
    That I will work against him. Therefore your oaths
    Are words and poor conditions, but unseal'd-
    At least in my opinion.
  BERTRAM. Change it, change it;
    Be not so holy-cruel. Love is holy;
    And my integrity ne'er knew the crafts
    That you do charge men with. Stand no more off,
    But give thyself unto my sick desires,
    Who then recovers. Say thou art mine, and ever
    My love as it begins shall so persever.
  DIANA. I see that men make ropes in such a scarre
    That we'll forsake ourselves. Give me that ring.
  BERTRAM. I'll lend it thee, my dear, but have no power
    To give it from me.
  DIANA. Will you not, my lord?
  BERTRAM. It is an honour 'longing to our house,
    Bequeathed down from many ancestors;
    Which were the greatest obloquy i' th' world
    In me to lose.
  DIANA. Mine honour's such a ring:
    My chastity's the jewel of our house,
    Bequeathed down from many ancestors;
    Which were the greatest obloquy i' th' world
    In me to lose. Thus your own proper wisdom
    Brings in the champion Honour on my part
    Against your vain assault.
  BERTRAM. Here, take my ring;
    My house, mine honour, yea, my life, be thine,
    And I'll be bid by thee.
  DIANA. When midnight comes, knock at my chamber window;
    I'll order take my mother shall not hear.
    Now will I charge you in the band of truth,
    When you have conquer'd my yet maiden bed,
    Remain there but an hour, nor speak to me:
    My reasons are most strong; and you shall know them
    When back again this ring shall be deliver'd.
    And on your finger in the night I'll put
    Another ring, that what in time proceeds
    May token to the future our past deeds.
    Adieu till then; then fail not. You have won
    A wife of me, though there my hope be done.
  BERTRAM. A heaven on earth I have won by wooing thee.
 Exit
  DIANA. For which live long to thank both heaven and me!
    You may so in the end.
    My mother told me just how he would woo,
    As if she sat in's heart; she says all men
    Have the like oaths. He had sworn to marry me
    When his wife's dead; therefore I'll lie with him
    When I am buried. Since Frenchmen are so braid,
    Marry that will, I live and die a maid.
    Only, in this disguise, I think't no sin
    To cozen him that would unjustly win.                   Exit




ACT IV. SCENE 3.
The Florentine camp

Enter the two FRENCH LORDS, and two or three SOLDIERS

  SECOND LORD. You have not given him his mother's letter?
  FIRST LORD. I have deliv'red it an hour since. There is something
    in't that stings his nature; for on the reading it he chang'd
    almost into another man.
  SECOND LORD. He has much worthy blame laid upon him for shaking off
    so good a wife and so sweet a lady.
  FIRST LORD. Especially he hath incurred the everlasting displeasure
    of the King, who had even tun'd his bounty to sing happiness to
    him. I will tell you a thing, but you shall let it dwell darkly
    with you.
  SECOND LORD. When you have spoken it, 'tis dead, and I am the grave
    of it.
  FIRST LORD. He hath perverted a young gentlewoman here in Florence,
    of a most chaste renown; and this night he fleshes his will in
    the spoil of her honour. He hath given her his monumental ring,
    and thinks himself made in the unchaste composition.
  SECOND LORD. Now, God delay our rebellion! As we are ourselves,
    what things are we!
  FIRST LORD. Merely our own traitors. And as in the common course of
    all treasons we still see them reveal themselves till they attain
    to their abhorr'd ends; so he that in this action contrives
    against his own nobility, in his proper stream, o'erflows
    himself.
  SECOND LORD. Is it not meant damnable in us to be trumpeters of our
    unlawful intents? We shall not then have his company to-night?
  FIRST LORD. Not till after midnight; for he is dieted to his hour.
  SECOND LORD. That approaches apace. I would gladly have him see his
    company anatomiz'd, that he might take a measure of his own
    judgments, wherein so curiously he had set this counterfeit.
  FIRST LORD. We will not meddle with him till he come; for his
    presence must be the whip of the other.
  SECOND LORD. In the meantime, what hear you of these wars?
  FIRST LORD. I hear there is an overture of peace.
  SECOND LORD. Nay, I assure you, a peace concluded.
  FIRST LORD. What will Count Rousillon do then? Will he travel
    higher, or return again into France?
  SECOND LORD. I perceive, by this demand, you are not altogether
    of his counsel.
  FIRST LORD. Let it be forbid, sir! So should I be a great deal
    of his act.
  SECOND LORD. Sir, his wife, some two months since, fled from his
    house. Her pretence is a pilgrimage to Saint Jaques le Grand;
    which holy undertaking with most austere sanctimony she
    accomplish'd; and, there residing, the tenderness of her nature
    became as a prey to her grief; in fine, made a groan of her last
    breath, and now she sings in heaven.
  FIRST LORD. How is this justified?
  SECOND LORD. The stronger part of it by her own letters, which
    makes her story true even to the point of her death. Her death
    itself, which could not be her office to say is come, was
    faithfully confirm'd by the rector of the place.
  FIRST LORD. Hath the Count all this intelligence?
  SECOND LORD. Ay, and the particular confirmations, point from
    point, to the full arming of the verity.
  FIRST LORD. I am heartily sorry that he'll be glad of this.
  SECOND LORD. How mightily sometimes we make us comforts of our
    losses!
  FIRST LORD. And how mightily some other times we drown our gain in
    tears! The great dignity that his valour hath here acquir'd for
    him shall at home be encount'red with a shame as ample.
  SECOND LORD. The web of our life is of a mingled yarn, good and ill
    together. Our virtues would be proud if our faults whipt them
    not; and our crimes would despair if they were not cherish'd by
    our virtues.

                      Enter a MESSENGER

    How now? Where's your master?
  SERVANT. He met the Duke in the street, sir; of whom he hath taken
    a solemn leave. His lordship will next morning for France. The
    Duke hath offered him letters of commendations to the King.
  SECOND LORD. They shall be no more than needful there, if they were
    more than they can commend.
  FIRST LORD. They cannot be too sweet for the King's tartness.
    Here's his lordship now.

                        Enter BERTRAM

    How now, my lord, is't not after midnight?
  BERTRAM. I have to-night dispatch'd sixteen businesses, a month's
    length apiece; by an abstract of success: I have congied with the
    Duke, done my adieu with his nearest; buried a wife, mourn'd for
    her; writ to my lady mother I am returning; entertain'd my
    convoy; and between these main parcels of dispatch effected many
    nicer needs. The last was the greatest, but that I have not ended
    yet.
  SECOND LORD. If the business be of any difficulty and this morning
    your departure hence, it requires haste of your lordship.
  BERTRAM. I mean the business is not ended, as fearing to hear of it
    hereafter. But shall we have this dialogue between the Fool and
    the Soldier? Come, bring forth this counterfeit module has
    deceiv'd me like a double-meaning prophesier.
  SECOND LORD. Bring him forth.  [Exeunt SOLDIERS]  Has sat i' th'
    stocks all night, poor gallant knave.
  BERTRAM. No matter; his heels have deserv'd it, in usurping his
    spurs so long. How does he carry himself?
  SECOND LORD. I have told your lordship already the stocks carry
    him. But to answer you as you would be understood: he weeps like
    a wench that had shed her milk; he hath confess'd himself to
    Morgan, whom he supposes to be a friar, from the time of his
    remembrance to this very instant disaster of his setting i' th'
    stocks. And what think you he hath confess'd?
  BERTRAM. Nothing of me, has 'a?
  SECOND LORD. His confession is taken, and it shall be read to his
    face; if your lordship be in't, as I believe you are, you must
    have the patience to hear it.

                   Enter PAROLLES guarded, and
                  FIRST SOLDIER as interpreter

  BERTRAM. A plague upon him! muffled! He can say nothing of me.
  SECOND LORD. Hush, hush! Hoodman comes. Portotartarossa.
  FIRST SOLDIER. He calls for the tortures. What will you say without
    'em?
  PAROLLES. I will confess what I know without constraint; if ye
    pinch me like a pasty, I can say no more.
  FIRST SOLDIER. Bosko chimurcho.
  SECOND LORD. Boblibindo chicurmurco.
  FIRST SOLDIER. YOU are a merciful general. Our General bids you
    answer to what I shall ask you out of a note.
  PAROLLES. And truly, as I hope to live.
  FIRST SOLDIER. 'First demand of him how many horse the Duke is
    strong.' What say you to that?
  PAROLLES. Five or six thousand; but very weak and unserviceable.
    The troops are all scattered, and the commanders very poor
    rogues, upon my reputation and credit, and as I hope to live.
  FIRST SOLDIER. Shall I set down your answer so?
  PAROLLES. Do; I'll take the sacrament on 't, how and which way you
    will.
  BERTRAM. All's one to him. What a past-saving slave is this!
  SECOND LORD. Y'are deceiv'd, my lord; this is Monsieur Parolles,
    the gallant militarist-that was his own phrase-that had the whole
    theoric of war in the knot of his scarf, and the practice in the
    chape of his dagger.
  FIRST LORD. I will never trust a man again for keeping his sword
    clean; nor believe he can have everything in him by wearing his
    apparel neatly.
  FIRST SOLDIER. Well, that's set down.
  PAROLLES. 'Five or six thousand horse' I said-I will say true- 'or
    thereabouts' set down, for I'll speak truth.
  SECOND LORD. He's very near the truth in this.
  BERTRAM. But I con him no thanks for't in the nature he delivers it.
  PAROLLES. 'Poor rogues' I pray you say.
  FIRST SOLDIER. Well, that's set down.
  PAROLLES. I humbly thank you, sir. A truth's a truth-the rogues are
    marvellous poor.
  FIRST SOLDIER. 'Demand of him of what strength they are a-foot.'
    What say you to that?
  PAROLLES. By my troth, sir, if I were to live this present hour, I
    will tell true. Let me see: Spurio, a hundred and fifty;
    Sebastian, so many; Corambus, so many; Jaques, so many; Guiltian,
    Cosmo, Lodowick, and Gratii, two hundred fifty each; mine own
    company, Chitopher, Vaumond, Bentii, two hundred fifty each; so
    that the muster-file, rotten and sound, upon my life, amounts not
    to fifteen thousand poll; half of the which dare not shake the
    snow from off their cassocks lest they shake themselves to
    pieces.
  BERTRAM. What shall be done to him?
  SECOND LORD. Nothing, but let him have thanks. Demand of him my
    condition, and what credit I have with the Duke.
  FIRST SOLDIER. Well, that's set down. 'You shall demand of him
    whether one Captain Dumain be i' th' camp, a Frenchman; what his
    reputation is with the Duke, what his valour, honesty, expertness
    in wars; or whether he thinks it were not possible, with
    well-weighing sums of gold, to corrupt him to a revolt.' What say
    you to this? What do you know of it?
  PAROLLES. I beseech you, let me answer to the particular of the
    inter'gatories. Demand them singly.
  FIRST SOLDIER. Do you know this Captain Dumain?
  PAROLLES. I know him: 'a was a botcher's prentice in Paris, from
    whence he was whipt for getting the shrieve's fool with child-a
    dumb innocent that could not say him nay.
  BERTRAM. Nay, by your leave, hold your hands; though I know his
    brains are forfeit to the next tile that falls.
  FIRST SOLDIER. Well, is this captain in the Duke of Florence's
    camp?
  PAROLLES. Upon my knowledge, he is, and lousy.
  SECOND LORD. Nay, look not so upon me; we shall hear of your
    lordship anon.
  FIRST SOLDIER. What is his reputation with the Duke?
  PAROLLES. The Duke knows him for no other but a poor officer of
    mine; and writ to me this other day to turn him out o' th' band.
    I think I have his letter in my pocket.
  FIRST SOLDIER. Marry, we'll search.
  PAROLLES. In good sadness, I do not know; either it is there or it
    is upon a file with the Duke's other letters in my tent.
  FIRST SOLDIER. Here 'tis; here's a paper. Shall I read it to you?
  PAROLLES. I do not know if it be it or no.
  BERTRAM. Our interpreter does it well.
  SECOND LORD. Excellently.
  FIRST SOLDIER.  [Reads]  'Dian, the Count's a fool, and full of
    gold.'
  PAROLLES. That is not the Duke's letter, sir; that is an
    advertisement to a proper maid in Florence, one Diana, to take
    heed of the allurement of one Count Rousillon, a foolish idle
    boy, but for all that very ruttish. I pray you, sir, put it up
    again.
  FIRST SOLDIER. Nay, I'll read it first by your favour.
  PAROLLES. My meaning in't, I protest, was very honest in the behalf
    of the maid; for I knew the young Count to be a dangerous and
    lascivious boy, who is a whale to virginity, and devours up all
    the fry it finds.
  BERTRAM. Damnable both-sides rogue!
  FIRST SOLDIER.                                         [Reads]
    'When he swears oaths, bid him drop gold, and take it;
    After he scores, he never pays the score.
    Half won is match well made; match, and well make it;
    He ne'er pays after-debts, take it before.
    And say a soldier, Dian, told thee this:
    Men are to mell with, boys are not to kiss;
    For count of this, the Count's a fool, I know it,
    Who pays before, but not when he does owe it.
    Thine, as he vow'd to thee in thine ear,
                                                   PAROLLES.'
  BERTRAM. He shall be whipt through the army with this rhyme in's
    forehead.
  FIRST LORD. This is your devoted friend, sir, the manifold
    linguist, and the amnipotent soldier.
  BERTRAM. I could endure anything before but a cat, and now he's a
    cat to me.
  FIRST SOLDIER. I perceive, sir, by our General's looks we shall be
    fain to hang you.
  PAROLLES. My life, sir, in any case! Not that I am afraid to die,
    but that, my offences being many, I would repent out the
    remainder of nature. Let me live, sir, in a dungeon, i' th'
    stocks, or anywhere, so I may live.
  FIRST SOLDIER. We'll see what may be done, so you confess freely;
    therefore, once more to this Captain Dumain: you have answer'd to
    his reputation with the Duke, and to his valour; what is his
    honesty?
  PAROLLES. He will steal, sir, an egg out of a cloister; for rapes
    and ravishments he parallels Nessus. He professes not keeping of
    oaths; in breaking 'em he is stronger than Hercules. He will lie,
    sir, with such volubility that you would think truth were a fool.
    Drunkenness is his best virtue, for he will be swine-drunk; and
    in his sleep he does little harm, save to his bedclothes about
    him; but they know his conditions and lay him in straw. I have
    but little more to say, sir, of his honesty. He has everything
    that an honest man should not have; what an honest man should
    have he has nothing.
  SECOND LORD. I begin to love him for this.
  BERTRAM. For this description of thine honesty? A pox upon him! For
    me, he's more and more a cat.
  FIRST SOLDIER. What say you to his expertness in war?
  PAROLLES. Faith, sir, has led the drum before the English
    tragedians-to belie him I will not-and more of his soldier-ship
    I know not, except in that country he had the honour to be the
    officer at a place there called Mile-end to instruct for the
    doubling of files-I would do the man what honour I can-but of
    this I am not certain.
  SECOND LORD. He hath out-villain'd villainy so far that the rarity
    redeems him.
  BERTRAM. A pox on him! he's a cat still.
  FIRST SOLDIER. His qualities being at this poor price, I need not
    to ask you if gold will corrupt him to revolt.
  PAROLLES. Sir, for a cardecue he will sell the fee-simple of his
    salvation, the inheritance of it; and cut th' entail from all
    remainders and a perpetual succession for it perpetually.
  FIRST SOLDIER. What's his brother, the other Captain Dumain?
  FIRST LORD. Why does he ask him of me?
  FIRST SOLDIER. What's he?
  PAROLLES. E'en a crow o' th' same nest; not altogether so great as
    the first in goodness, but greater a great deal in evil. He
    excels his brother for a coward; yet his brother is reputed one
    of the best that is. In a retreat he outruns any lackey: marry,
    in coming on he has the cramp.
  FIRST SOLDIER. If your life be saved, will you undertake to betray
    the Florentine?
  PAROLLES. Ay, and the Captain of his Horse, Count Rousillon.
  FIRST SOLDIER. I'll whisper with the General, and know his
    pleasure.
  PAROLLES.  [Aside]  I'll no more drumming. A plague of all drums!
    Only to seem to deserve well, and to beguile the supposition of
    that lascivious young boy the Count, have I run into this danger.
    Yet who would have suspected an ambush where I was taken?
  FIRST SOLDIER. There is no remedy, sir, but you must die.
    The General says you that have so traitorously discover'd the
    secrets of your army, and made such pestiferous reports of men
    very nobly held, can serve the world for no honest use; therefore
    you must die. Come, headsman, of with his head.
  PAROLLES. O Lord, sir, let me live, or let me see my death!
  FIRST SOLDIER. That shall you, and take your leave of all your
    friends.  [Unmuffling him]  So look about you; know you any here?
  BERTRAM. Good morrow, noble Captain.
  FIRST LORD. God bless you, Captain Parolles.
  SECOND LORD. God save you, noble Captain.
  FIRST LORD. Captain, what greeting will you to my Lord Lafeu? I am
    for France.
  SECOND LORD. Good Captain, will you give me a copy of the sonnet
    you writ to Diana in behalf of the Count Rousillon? An I were not
    a very coward I'd compel it of you; but fare you well.
                                        Exeunt BERTRAM and LORDS
  FIRST SOLDIER. You are undone, Captain, all but your scarf; that
    has a knot on 't yet.
  PAROLLES. Who cannot be crush'd with a plot?
  FIRST SOLDIER. If you could find out a country where but women were
    that had received so much shame, you might begin an impudent
    nation. Fare ye well, sir; I am for France too; we shall speak of
    you there.                                Exit with SOLDIERS
  PAROLLES. Yet am I thankful. If my heart were great,
    'Twould burst at this. Captain I'll be no more;
    But I will eat, and drink, and sleep as soft
    As captain shall. Simply the thing I am
    Shall make me live. Who knows himself a braggart,
    Let him fear this; for it will come to pass
    That every braggart shall be found an ass.
    Rust, sword; cool, blushes; and, Parolles, live
    Safest in shame. Being fool'd, by fool'ry thrive.
    There's place and means for every man alive.
    I'll after them.                                        Exit




ACT IV SCENE 4.
The WIDOW'S house

Enter HELENA, WIDOW, and DIANA

  HELENA. That you may well perceive I have not wrong'd you!
    One of the greatest in the Christian world
    Shall be my surety; fore whose throne 'tis needful,
    Ere I can perfect mine intents, to kneel.
    Time was I did him a desired office,
    Dear almost as his life; which gratitude
    Through flinty Tartar's bosom would peep forth,
    And answer 'Thanks.' I duly am inform'd
    His Grace is at Marseilles, to which place
    We have convenient convoy. You must know
    I am supposed dead. The army breaking,
    My husband hies him home; where, heaven aiding,
    And by the leave of my good lord the King,
    We'll be before our welcome.
  WIDOW. Gentle madam,
    You never had a servant to whose trust
    Your business was more welcome.
  HELENA. Nor you, mistress,
    Ever a friend whose thoughts more truly labour
    To recompense your love. Doubt not but heaven
    Hath brought me up to be your daughter's dower,
    As it hath fated her to be my motive
    And helper to a husband. But, O strange men!
    That can such sweet use make of what they hate,
    When saucy trusting of the cozen'd thoughts
    Defiles the pitchy night. So lust doth play
    With what it loathes, for that which is away.
    But more of this hereafter. You, Diana,
    Under my poor instructions yet must suffer
    Something in my behalf.
  DIANA. Let death and honesty
    Go with your impositions, I am yours
    Upon your will to suffer.
  HELENA. Yet, I pray you:
    But with the word the time will bring on summer,
    When briers shall have leaves as well as thorns
    And be as sweet as sharp. We must away;
    Our waggon is prepar'd, and time revives us.
    All's Well that Ends Well. Still the fine's the crown.
    Whate'er the course, the end is the renown.           Exeunt




ACT IV SCENE 5.
Rousillon. The COUNT'S palace

Enter COUNTESS, LAFEU, and CLOWN

  LAFEU. No, no, no, son was misled with a snipt-taffeta fellow
    there, whose villainous saffron would have made all the unbak'd
    and doughy youth of a nation in his colour. Your daughter-in-law
    had been alive at this hour, and your son here at home, more
    advanc'd by the King than by that red-tail'd humble-bee I speak
    of.
  COUNTESS. I would I had not known him. It was the death of the most
    virtuous gentlewoman that ever nature had praise for creating. If
    she had partaken of my flesh, and cost me the dearest groans of a
    mother. I could not have owed her a more rooted love.
  LAFEU. 'Twas a good lady, 'twas a good lady. We may pick a thousand
    sallets ere we light on such another herb.
  CLOWN. Indeed, sir, she was the sweet-marjoram of the sallet, or,
    rather, the herb of grace.
  LAFEU. They are not sallet-herbs, you knave; they are nose-herbs.
  CLOWN. I am no great Nebuchadnezzar, sir; I have not much skill in
    grass.
  LAFEU. Whether dost thou profess thyself-a knave or a fool?
  CLOWN. A fool, sir, at a woman's service, and a knave at a man's.
  LAFEU. Your distinction?
  CLOWN. I would cozen the man of his wife, and do his service.
  LAFEU. So you were a knave at his service, indeed.
  CLOWN. And I would give his wife my bauble, sir, to do her service.
  LAFEU. I will subscribe for thee; thou art both knave and fool.
  CLOWN. At your service.
  LAFEU. No, no, no.
  CLOWN. Why, sir, if I cannot serve you, I can serve as great a
    prince as you are.
  LAFEU. Who's that? A Frenchman?
  CLOWN. Faith, sir, 'a has an English name; but his fisnomy is more
    hotter in France than there.
  LAFEU. What prince is that?
  CLOWN. The Black Prince, sir; alias, the Prince of Darkness; alias,
    the devil.
  LAFEU. Hold thee, there's my purse. I give thee not this to suggest
    thee from thy master thou talk'st of; serve him still.
  CLOWN. I am a woodland fellow, sir, that always loved a great fire;
    and the master I speak of ever keeps a good fire. But, sure, he
    is the prince of the world; let his nobility remain in's court. I
    am for the house with the narrow gate, which I take to be too
    little for pomp to enter. Some that humble themselves may; but
    the many will be too chill and tender: and they'll be for the
    flow'ry way that leads to the broad gate and the great fire.
  LAFEU. Go thy ways, I begin to be aweary of thee; and I tell thee
    so before, because I would not fall out with thee. Go thy ways;
    let my horses be well look'd to, without any tricks.
  CLOWN. If I put any tricks upon 'em, sir, they shall be jades'
    tricks, which are their own right by the law of nature.
 Exit
  LAFEU. A shrewd knave, and an unhappy.
  COUNTESS. So 'a is. My lord that's gone made himself much  sport
    out of him. By his authority he remains here, which he thinks is
    a patent for his sauciness; and indeed he has no pace, but runs
    where he will.
  LAFEU. I like him well; 'tis not amiss. And I was about to tell
    you, since I heard of the good lady's death, and that my lord
    your son was upon his return home, I moved the King my master to
    speak in the behalf of my daughter; which, in the minority of
    them both, his Majesty out of a self-gracious remembrance did
    first propose. His Highness hath promis'd me to do it; and, to
    stop up the displeasure he hath conceived against your son, there
    is no fitter matter. How does your ladyship like it?
  COUNTESS. With very much content, my lord; and I wish it happily
    effected.
  LAFEU. His Highness comes post from Marseilles, of as able body as
    when he number'd thirty; 'a will be here to-morrow, or I am
    deceiv'd by him that in such intelligence hath seldom fail'd.
  COUNTESS. It rejoices me that I hope I shall see him ere I die.
    I have letters that my son will be here to-night. I shall beseech
    your lordship to remain with me tal they meet together.
  LAFEU. Madam, I was thinking with what manners I might safely be
    admitted.
  COUNTESS. You need but plead your honourable privilege.
  LAFEU. Lady, of that I have made a bold charter; but, I thank my
    God, it holds yet.

                         Re-enter CLOWN

  CLOWN. O madam, yonder's my lord your son with a patch of velvet
    on's face; whether there be a scar under 't or no, the velvet
    knows; but 'tis a goodly patch of velvet. His left cheek is a
    cheek of two pile and a half, but his right cheek is worn bare.
  LAFEU. A scar nobly got, or a noble scar, is a good liv'ry of
    honour; so belike is that.
  CLOWN. But it is your carbonado'd face.
  LAFEU. Let us go see your son, I pray you;
    I long to talk with the young noble soldier.
  CLOWN. Faith, there's a dozen of 'em, with delicate fine hats, and
    most courteous feathers, which bow the head and nod at every man.
                                                          Exeunt

ACT V. SCENE 1.
Marseilles. A street

Enter HELENA, WIDOW, and DIANA, with two ATTENDANTS

  HELENA. But this exceeding posting day and night
    Must wear your spirits low; we cannot help it.
    But since you have made the days and nights as one,
    To wear your gentle limbs in my affairs,
    Be bold you do so grow in my requital
    As nothing can unroot you.

                      Enter a GENTLEMAN

    In happy time!
    This man may help me to his Majesty's ear,
    If he would spend his power. God save you, sir.
  GENTLEMAN. And you.
  HELENA. Sir, I have seen you in the court of France.
  GENTLEMAN. I have been sometimes there.
  HELENA. I do presume, sir, that you are not fall'n
    From the report that goes upon your goodness;
    And therefore, goaded with most sharp occasions,
    Which lay nice manners by, I put you to
    The use of your own virtues, for the which
    I shall continue thankful.
  GENTLEMAN. What's your will?
  HELENA. That it will please you
    To give this poor petition to the King;
    And aid me with that store of power you have
    To come into his presence.
  GENTLEMAN. The King's not here.
  HELENA. Not here, sir?
  GENTLEMAN. Not indeed.
    He hence remov'd last night, and with more haste
    Than is his use.
  WIDOW. Lord, how we lose our pains!
  HELENA. All's Well That Ends Well yet,
    Though time seem so adverse and means unfit.
    I do beseech you, whither is he gone?
  GENTLEMAN. Marry, as I take it, to Rousillon;
    Whither I am going.
  HELENA. I do beseech you, sir,
    Since you are like to see the King before me,
    Commend the paper to his gracious hand;
    Which I presume shall render you no blame,
    But rather make you thank your pains for it.
    I will come after you with what good speed
    Our means will make us means.
  GENTLEMAN. This I'll do for you.
  HELENA. And you shall find yourself to be well thank'd,
    Whate'er falls more. We must to horse again;
    Go, go, provide.                                      Exeunt




ACT V SCENE 2.
Rousillon. The inner court of the COUNT'S palace

Enter CLOWN and PAROLLES

  PAROLLES. Good Monsieur Lavache, give my Lord Lafeu this letter. I
    have ere now, sir, been better known to you, when I have held
    familiarity with fresher clothes; but I am now, sir, muddied in
    Fortune's mood, and smell somewhat strong of her strong
    displeasure.
  CLOWN. Truly, Fortune's displeasure is but sluttish, if it smell
    so strongly as thou speak'st of. I will henceforth eat no fish
    of Fortune's butt'ring. Prithee, allow the wind.
  PAROLLES. Nay, you need not to stop your nose, sir; I spake but by
    a metaphor.
  CLOWN. Indeed, sir, if your metaphor stink, I will stop my nose; or
    against any man's metaphor. Prithee, get thee further.
  PAROLLES. Pray you, sir, deliver me this paper.
  CLOWN. Foh! prithee stand away. A paper from Fortune's close-stool
    to give to a nobleman! Look here he comes himself.

                           Enter LAFEU

    Here is a pur of Fortune's, sir, or of Fortune's cat, but not
    a musk-cat, that has fall'n into the unclean fishpond of her
    displeasure, and, as he says, is muddied withal. Pray you, sir,
    use the carp as you may; for he looks like a poor, decayed,
    ingenious, foolish, rascally knave. I do pity his distress
    in my similes of comfort, and leave him to your lordship.
 Exit
  PAROLLES. My lord, I am a man whom Fortune hath cruelly scratch'd.
  LAFEU. And what would you have me to do? 'Tis too late to pare her
    nails now. Wherein have you played the knave with Fortune, that
    she should scratch you, who of herself is a good lady and would
    not have knaves thrive long under her? There's a cardecue for
    you. Let the justices make you and Fortune friends; I am for
    other business.
  PAROLLES. I beseech your honour to hear me one single word.
  LAFEU. You beg a single penny more; come, you shall ha't; save your
    word.
  PAROLLES. My name, my good lord, is Parolles.
  LAFEU. You beg more than word then. Cox my passion! give me your
    hand. How does your drum?
  PAROLLES. O my good lord, you were the first that found me.
  LAFEU. Was I, in sooth? And I was the first that lost thee.
  PAROLLES. It lies in you, my lord, to bring me in some grace, for
    you did bring me out.
  LAFEU. Out upon thee, knave! Dost thou put upon me at once both the
    office of God and the devil? One brings the in grace, and the
    other brings thee out.    [Trumpets sound]  The King's coming; I
    know by his trumpets. Sirrah, inquire further after me; I had
    talk of you last night. Though you are a fool and a knave, you
    shall eat. Go to; follow.
  PAROLLES. I praise God for you.                         Exeunt




ACT V SCENE 3.
Rousillon. The COUNT'S palace

Flourish. Enter KING, COUNTESS, LAFEU, the two FRENCH LORDS, with ATTENDANTS

  KING. We lost a jewel of her, and our esteem
    Was made much poorer by it; but your son,
    As mad in folly, lack'd the sense to know
    Her estimation home.
  COUNTESS. 'Tis past, my liege;
    And I beseech your Majesty to make it
    Natural rebellion, done i' th' blaze of youth,
    When oil and fire, too strong for reason's force,
    O'erbears it and burns on.
  KING. My honour'd lady,
    I have forgiven and forgotten all;
    Though my revenges were high bent upon him
    And watch'd the time to shoot.
  LAFEU. This I must say-
    But first, I beg my pardon: the young lord
    Did to his Majesty, his mother, and his lady,
    Offence of mighty note; but to himself
    The greatest wrong of all. He lost a wife
    Whose beauty did astonish the survey
    Of richest eyes; whose words all ears took captive;
    Whose dear perfection hearts that scorn'd to serve
    Humbly call'd mistress.
  KING. Praising what is lost
    Makes the remembrance dear. Well, call him hither;
    We are reconcil'd, and the first view shall kill
    All repetition. Let him not ask our pardon;
    The nature of his great offence is dead,
    And deeper than oblivion do we bury
    Th' incensing relics of it; let him approach,
    A stranger, no offender; and inform him
    So 'tis our will he should.
  GENTLEMAN. I shall, my liege.                 Exit GENTLEMAN
  KING. What says he to your daughter? Have you spoke?
  LAFEU. All that he is hath reference to your Highness.
  KING. Then shall we have a match. I have letters sent me
    That sets him high in fame.

                          Enter BERTRAM

  LAFEU. He looks well on 't.
  KING. I am not a day of season,
    For thou mayst see a sunshine and a hail
    In me at once. But to the brightest beams
    Distracted clouds give way; so stand thou forth;
    The time is fair again.
  BERTRAM. My high-repented blames,
    Dear sovereign, pardon to me.
  KING. All is whole;
    Not one word more of the consumed time.
    Let's take the instant by the forward top;
    For we are old, and on our quick'st decrees
    Th' inaudible and noiseless foot of Time
    Steals ere we can effect them. You remember
    The daughter of this lord?
  BERTRAM. Admiringly, my liege. At first
    I stuck my choice upon her, ere my heart
    Durst make too bold herald of my tongue;
    Where the impression of mine eye infixing,
    Contempt his scornful perspective did lend me,
    Which warp'd the line of every other favour,
    Scorn'd a fair colour or express'd it stol'n,
    Extended or contracted all proportions
    To a most hideous object. Thence it came
    That she whom all men prais'd, and whom myself,
    Since I have lost, have lov'd, was in mine eye
    The dust that did offend it.
  KING. Well excus'd.
    That thou didst love her, strikes some scores away
    From the great compt; but love that comes too late,
    Like a remorseful pardon slowly carried,
    To the great sender turns a sour offence,
    Crying 'That's good that's gone.' Our rash faults
    Make trivial price of serious things we have,
    Not knowing them until we know their grave.
    Oft our displeasures, to ourselves unjust,
    Destroy our friends, and after weep their dust;
    Our own love waking cries to see what's done,
    While shameful hate sleeps out the afternoon.
    Be this sweet Helen's knell. And now forget her.
    Send forth your amorous token for fair Maudlin.
    The main consents are had; and here we'll stay
    To see our widower's second marriage-day.
  COUNTESS. Which better than the first, O dear heaven, bless!
    Or, ere they meet, in me, O nature, cesse!
  LAFEU. Come on, my son, in whom my house's name
    Must be digested; give a favour from you,
    To sparkle in the spirits of my daughter,
    That she may quickly come.
                                          [BERTRAM gives a ring]
    By my old beard,
    And ev'ry hair that's on 't, Helen, that's dead,
    Was a sweet creature; such a ring as this,
    The last that e'er I took her leave at court,
    I saw upon her finger.
  BERTRAM. Hers it was not.
  KING. Now, pray you, let me see it; for mine eye,
    While I was speaking, oft was fasten'd to't.
    This ring was mine; and when I gave it Helen
    I bade her, if her fortunes ever stood
    Necessitied to help, that by this token
    I would relieve her. Had you that craft to reave her
    Of what should stead her most?
  BERTRAM. My gracious sovereign,
    Howe'er it pleases you to take it so,
    The ring was never hers.
  COUNTESS. Son, on my life,
    I have seen her wear it; and she reckon'd it
    At her life's rate.
  LAFEU. I am sure I saw her wear it.
  BERTRAM. You are deceiv'd, my lord; she never saw it.
    In Florence was it from a casement thrown me,
    Wrapp'd in a paper, which contain'd the name
    Of her that threw it. Noble she was, and thought
    I stood engag'd; but when I had subscrib'd
    To mine own fortune, and inform'd her fully
    I could not answer in that course of honour
    As she had made the overture, she ceas'd,
    In heavy satisfaction, and would never
    Receive the ring again.
  KING. Plutus himself,
    That knows the tinct and multiplying med'cine,
    Hath not in nature's mystery more science
    Than I have in this ring. 'Twas mine, 'twas Helen's,
    Whoever gave it you. Then, if you know
    That you are well acquainted with yourself,
    Confess 'twas hers, and by what rough enforcement
    You got it from her. She call'd the saints to surety
    That she would never put it from her finger
    Unless she gave it to yourself in bed-
    Where you have never come- or sent it us
    Upon her great disaster.
  BERTRAM. She never saw it.
  KING. Thou speak'st it falsely, as I love mine honour;
    And mak'st conjectural fears to come into me
    Which I would fain shut out. If it should prove
    That thou art so inhuman- 'twill not prove so.
    And yet I know not- thou didst hate her deadly,
    And she is dead; which nothing, but to close
    Her eyes myself, could win me to believe
    More than to see this ring. Take him away.
                                          [GUARDS seize BERTRAM]
    My fore-past proofs, howe'er the matter fall,
    Shall tax my fears of little vanity,
    Having vainly fear'd too little. Away with him.
    We'll sift this matter further.
  BERTRAM. If you shall prove
    This ring was ever hers, you shall as easy
    Prove that I husbanded her bed in Florence,
    Where she yet never was.                       Exit, guarded
  KING. I am wrapp'd in dismal thinkings.

                        Enter a GENTLEMAN

  GENTLEMAN. Gracious sovereign,
    Whether I have been to blame or no, I know not:
    Here's a petition from a Florentine,
    Who hath, for four or five removes, come short
    To tender it herself. I undertook it,
    Vanquish'd thereto by the fair grace and speech
    Of the poor suppliant, who by this, I know,
    Is here attending; her business looks in her
    With an importing visage; and she told me
    In a sweet verbal brief it did concern
    Your Highness with herself.
  KING.  [Reads the letter]  'Upon his many protestations to marry me
    when his wife was dead, I blush to say it, he won me. Now is the
    Count Rousillon a widower; his vows are forfeited to me, and my
    honour's paid to him. He stole from Florence, taking no leave,
    and I follow him to his country for justice. Grant it me, O King!
    in you it best lies; otherwise a seducer flourishes, and a poor
    maid is undone.
                                                DIANA CAPILET.'
  LAFEU. I will buy me a son-in-law in a fair, and toll for this.
    I'll none of him.
  KING. The heavens have thought well on thee, Lafeu,
    To bring forth this discov'ry. Seek these suitors.
    Go speedily, and bring again the Count.
                                               Exeunt ATTENDANTS
    I am afeard the life of Helen, lady,
    Was foully snatch'd.
  COUNTESS. Now, justice on the doers!

                       Enter BERTRAM, guarded

  KING. I wonder, sir, sith wives are monsters to you.
    And that you fly them as you swear them lordship,
    Yet you desire to marry.
                                           Enter WIDOW and DIANA
    What woman's that?
  DIANA. I am, my lord, a wretched Florentine,
    Derived from the ancient Capilet.
    My suit, as I do understand, you know,
    And therefore know how far I may be pitied.
  WIDOW. I am her mother, sir, whose age and honour
    Both suffer under this complaint we bring,
    And both shall cease, without your remedy.
  KING. Come hither, Count; do you know these women?
  BERTRAM. My lord, I neither can nor will deny
    But that I know them. Do they charge me further?
  DIANA. Why do you look so strange upon your wife?
  BERTRAM. She's none of mine, my lord.
  DIANA. If you shall marry,
    You give away this hand, and that is mine;
    You give away heaven's vows, and those are mine;
    You give away myself, which is known mine;
    For I by vow am so embodied yours
    That she which marries you must marry me,
    Either both or none.
  LAFEU.  [To BERTRAM]  Your reputation comes too short for
    my daughter; you are no husband for her.
  BERTRAM. My lord, this is a fond and desp'rate creature
    Whom sometime I have laugh'd with. Let your Highness
    Lay a more noble thought upon mine honour
    Than for to think that I would sink it here.
  KING. Sir, for my thoughts, you have them ill to friend
    Till your deeds gain them. Fairer prove your honour
    Than in my thought it lies!
  DIANA. Good my lord,
    Ask him upon his oath if he does think
    He had not my virginity.
  KING. What say'st thou to her?
  BERTRAM. She's impudent, my lord,
    And was a common gamester to the camp.
  DIANA. He does me wrong, my lord; if I were so
    He might have bought me at a common price.
    Do not believe him. o, behold this ring,
    Whose high respect and rich validity
    Did lack a parallel; yet, for all that,
    He gave it to a commoner o' th' camp,
    If I be one.
  COUNTESS. He blushes, and 'tis it.
    Of six preceding ancestors, that gem
    Conferr'd by testament to th' sequent issue,
    Hath it been ow'd and worn. This is his wife:
    That ring's a thousand proofs.
  KING. Methought you said
    You saw one here in court could witness it.
  DIANA. I did, my lord, but loath am to produce
    So bad an instrument; his name's Parolles.
  LAFEU. I saw the man to-day, if man he be.
  KING. Find him, and bring him hither.        Exit an ATTENDANT
  BERTRAM. What of him?
    He's quoted for a most perfidious slave,
    With all the spots o' th' world tax'd and debauch'd,
    Whose nature sickens but to speak a truth.
    Am I or that or this for what he'll utter
    That will speak anything?
  KING. She hath that ring of yours.
  BERTRAM. I think she has. Certain it is I lik'd her,
    And boarded her i' th' wanton way of youth.
    She knew her distance, and did angle for me,
    Madding my eagerness with her restraint,
    As all impediments in fancy's course
    Are motives of more fancy; and, in fine,
    Her infinite cunning with her modern grace
    Subdu'd me to her rate. She got the ring;
    And I had that which any inferior might
    At market-price have bought.
  DIANA. I must be patient.
    You that have turn'd off a first so noble wife
    May justly diet me. I pray you yet-
    Since you lack virtue, I will lose a husband-
    Send for your ring, I will return it home,
    And give me mine again.
  BERTRAM. I have it not.
  KING. What ring was yours, I pray you?
  DIANA. Sir, much like
    The same upon your finger.
  KING. Know you this ring? This ring was his of late.
  DIANA. And this was it I gave him, being abed.
  KING. The story, then, goes false you threw it him
    Out of a casement.
  DIANA. I have spoke the truth.

                       Enter PAROLLES

  BERTRAM. My lord, I do confess the ring was hers.
  KING. You boggle shrewdly; every feather starts you.
    Is this the man you speak of?
  DIANA. Ay, my lord.
  KING. Tell me, sirrah-but tell me true I charge you,
    Not fearing the displeasure of your master,
    Which, on your just proceeding, I'll keep off-
    By him and by this woman here what know you?
  PAROLLES. So please your Majesty, my master hath been an honourable
    gentleman; tricks he hath had in him, which gentlemen have.
  KING. Come, come, to th' purpose. Did he love this woman?
  PAROLLES. Faith, sir, he did love her; but how?
  KING. How, I pray you?
  PAROLLES. He did love her, sir, as a gentleman loves a woman.
  KING. How is that?
  PAROLLES. He lov'd her, sir, and lov'd her not.
  KING. As thou art a knave and no knave.
    What an equivocal companion is this!
  PAROLLES. I am a poor man, and at your Majesty's command.
  LAFEU. He's a good drum, my lord, but a naughty orator.
  DIANA. Do you know he promis'd me marriage?
  PAROLLES. Faith, I know more than I'll speak.
  KING. But wilt thou not speak all thou know'st?
  PAROLLES. Yes, so please your Majesty. I did go between them, as I
    said; but more than that, he loved her-for indeed he was mad for
    her, and talk'd of Satan, and of Limbo, and of Furies, and I know
    not what. Yet I was in that credit with them at that time that I
    knew of their going to bed; and of other motions, as promising
    her marriage, and things which would derive me ill will to speak
    of; therefore I will not speak what I know.
  KING. Thou hast spoken all already, unless thou canst say they are
    married; but thou art too fine in thy evidence; therefore stand
    aside.
    This ring, you say, was yours?
  DIANA. Ay, my good lord.
  KING. Where did you buy it? Or who gave it you?
  DIANA. It was not given me, nor I did not buy it.
  KING. Who lent it you?
  DIANA. It was not lent me neither.
  KING. Where did you find it then?
  DIANA. I found it not.
  KING. If it were yours by none of all these ways,
    How could you give it him?
  DIANA. I never gave it him.
  LAFEU. This woman's an easy glove, my lord; she goes of and on at
    pleasure.
  KING. This ring was mine, I gave it his first wife.
  DIANA. It might be yours or hers, for aught I know.
  KING. Take her away, I do not like her now;
    To prison with her. And away with him.
    Unless thou tell'st me where thou hadst this ring,
    Thou diest within this hour.
  DIANA. I'll never tell you.
  KING. Take her away.
  DIANA. I'll put in bail, my liege.
  KING. I think thee now some common customer.
  DIANA. By Jove, if ever I knew man, 'twas you.
  KING. Wherefore hast thou accus'd him all this while?
  DIANA. Because he's guilty, and he is not guilty.
    He knows I am no maid, and he'll swear to't:
    I'll swear I am a maid, and he knows not.
    Great King, I am no strumpet, by my life;
    I am either maid, or else this old man's wife.
                                             [Pointing to LAFEU]
  KING. She does abuse our ears; to prison with her.
  DIANA. Good mother, fetch my bail. Stay, royal sir;
                                                      Exit WIDOW
    The jeweller that owes the ring is sent for,
    And he shall surety me. But for this lord
    Who hath abus'd me as he knows himself,
    Though yet he never harm'd me, here I quit him.
    He knows himself my bed he hath defil'd;
    And at that time he got his wife with child.
    Dead though she be, she feels her young one kick;
    So there's my riddle: one that's dead is quick-
    And now behold the meaning.

                     Re-enter WIDOW with HELENA

  KING. Is there no exorcist
    Beguiles the truer office of mine eyes?
    Is't real that I see?
  HELENA. No, my good lord;
    'Tis but the shadow of a wife you see,
    The name and not the thing.
  BERTRAM. Both, both; o, pardon!
  HELENA. O, my good lord, when I was like this maid,
    I found you wondrous kind. There is your ring,
    And, look you, here's your letter. This it says:
    'When from my finger you can get this ring,
    And are by me with child,' etc. This is done.
    Will you be mine now you are doubly won?
  BERTRAM. If she, my liege, can make me know this clearly,
    I'll love her dearly, ever, ever dearly.
  HELENA. If it appear not plain, and prove untrue,
    Deadly divorce step between me and you!
    O my dear mother, do I see you living?
  LAFEU. Mine eyes smell onions; I shall weep anon. [To PAROLLES]
    Good Tom Drum, lend me a handkercher. So, I
    thank thee. Wait on me home, I'll make sport with thee;
    let thy curtsies alone, they are scurvy ones.
  KING. Let us from point to point this story know,
    To make the even truth in pleasure flow.
    [To DIANA]  If thou beest yet a fresh uncropped flower,
    Choose thou thy husband, and I'll pay thy dower;
    For I can guess that by thy honest aid
    Thou kept'st a wife herself, thyself a maid.-
    Of that and all the progress, more and less,
    Resolvedly more leisure shall express.
    All yet seems well; and if it end so meet,
    The bitter past, more welcome is the sweet.       [Flourish]

EPILOGUE
                             EPILOGUE.

  KING. The King's a beggar, now the play is done.
    All is well ended if this suit be won,
    That you express content; which we will pay
    With strife to please you, day exceeding day.
    Ours be your patience then, and yours our parts;
    Your gentle hands lend us, and take our hearts.
                                                    Exeunt omnes

  PHILO. Nay, but this dotage of our general's
    O'erflows the measure. Those his goodly eyes,
    That o'er the files and musters of the war
    Have glow'd like plated Mars, now bend, now turn,
    The office and devotion of their view
    Upon a tawny front. His captain's heart,
    Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst
    The buckles on his breast, reneges all temper,
    And is become the bellows and the fan
    To cool a gipsy's lust.
     Flourish. Enter ANTONY, CLEOPATRA, her LADIES, the train,
                    with eunuchs fanning her
    Look where they come!
    Take but good note, and you shall see in him
    The triple pillar of the world transform'd
    Into a strumpet's fool. Behold and see.
  CLEOPATRA. If it be love indeed, tell me how much.
  ANTONY. There's beggary in the love that can be reckon'd.
  CLEOPATRA. I'll set a bourn how far to be belov'd.
  ANTONY. Then must thou needs find out new heaven, new earth.

  MESSENGER. News, my good lord, from Rome.
  ANTONY. Grates me the sum.
  CLEOPATRA. Nay, hear them, Antony.
    Fulvia perchance is angry; or who knows
    If the scarce-bearded Caesar have not sent
    His pow'rful mandate to you: 'Do this or this;
    Take in that kingdom and enfranchise that;
    Perform't, or else we damn thee.'
  ANTONY. How, my love?
  CLEOPATRA. Perchance? Nay, and most like,
    You must not stay here longer; your dismission
    Is come from Caesar; therefore hear it, Antony.
    Where's Fulvia's process? Caesar's I would say? Both?
    Call in the messengers. As I am Egypt's Queen,
    Thou blushest, Antony, and that blood of thine
    Is Caesar's homager. Else so thy cheek pays shame
    When shrill-tongu'd Fulvia scolds. The messengers!
  ANTONY. Let Rome in Tiber melt, and the wide arch
    Of the rang'd empire fall! Here is my space.
    Kingdoms are clay; our dungy earth alike
    Feeds beast as man. The nobleness of life
    Is to do thus [emhracing], when such a mutual pair
    And such a twain can do't, in which I bind,
    On pain of punishment, the world to weet
    We stand up peerless.
  CLEOPATRA. Excellent falsehood!
    Why did he marry Fulvia, and not love her?
    I'll seem the fool I am not. Antony
    Will be himself.
  ANTONY. But stirr'd by Cleopatra.
    Now for the love of Love and her soft hours,
    Let's not confound the time with conference harsh;
    There's not a minute of our lives should stretch
    Without some pleasure now. What sport to-night?
  CLEOPATRA. Hear the ambassadors.
  ANTONY. Fie, wrangling queen!
    Whom everything becomes- to chide, to laugh,
    To weep; whose every passion fully strives
    To make itself in thee fair and admir'd.
    No messenger but thine, and all alone
    To-night we'll wander through the streets and note
    The qualities of people. Come, my queen;
    Last night you did desire it. Speak not to us.
                     Exeunt ANTONY and CLEOPATRA, with the train
  DEMETRIUS. Is Caesar with Antonius priz'd so slight?
  PHILO. Sir, sometimes when he is not Antony,
    He comes too short of that great property
    Which still should go with Antony.
  DEMETRIUS. I am full sorry
    That he approves the common liar, who
    Thus speaks of him at Rome; but I will hope
    Of better deeds to-morrow. Rest you happy!            Exeunt




SCENE II.
Alexandria. CLEOPATRA'S palace

Enter CHARMIAN, IRAS, ALEXAS, and a SOOTHSAYER

  CHARMIAN. Lord Alexas, sweet Alexas, most anything Alexas, almost
    most absolute Alexas, where's the soothsayer that you prais'd so
    to th' Queen? O that I knew this husband, which you say must
    charge his horns with garlands!
  ALEXAS. Soothsayer!
  SOOTHSAYER. Your will?
  CHARMIAN. Is this the man? Is't you, sir, that know things?
  SOOTHSAYER. In nature's infinite book of secrecy
    A little I can read.
  ALEXAS. Show him your hand.

                       Enter ENOBARBUS

  ENOBARBUS. Bring in the banquet quickly; wine enough
    Cleopatra's health to drink.
  CHARMIAN. Good, sir, give me good fortune.
  SOOTHSAYER. I make not, but foresee.
  CHARMIAN. Pray, then, foresee me one.
  SOOTHSAYER. You shall be yet far fairer than you are.
  CHARMIAN. He means in flesh.
  IRAS. No, you shall paint when you are old.
  CHARMIAN. Wrinkles forbid!
  ALEXAS. Vex not his prescience; be attentive.
  CHARMIAN. Hush!
  SOOTHSAYER. You shall be more beloving than beloved.
  CHARMIAN. I had rather heat my liver with drinking.
  ALEXAS. Nay, hear him.
  CHARMIAN. Good now, some excellent fortune! Let me be married to
    three kings in a forenoon, and widow them all. Let me have a
    child at fifty, to whom Herod of Jewry may do homage. Find me to
    marry me with Octavius Caesar, and companion me with my mistress.
  SOOTHSAYER. You shall outlive the lady whom you serve.
  CHARMIAN. O, excellent! I love long life better than figs.
  SOOTHSAYER. You have seen and prov'd a fairer former fortune
    Than that which is to approach.
  CHARMIAN. Then belike my children shall have no names.
    Prithee, how many boys and wenches must I have?
  SOOTHSAYER. If every of your wishes had a womb,
    And fertile every wish, a million.
  CHARMIAN. Out, fool! I forgive thee for a witch.
  ALEXAS. You think none but your sheets are privy to your wishes.
  CHARMIAN. Nay, come, tell Iras hers.
  ALEXAS. We'll know all our fortunes.
  ENOBARBUS. Mine, and most of our fortunes, to-night, shall be-
    drunk to bed.
  IRAS. There's a palm presages chastity, if nothing else.
  CHARMIAN. E'en as the o'erflowing Nilus presageth famine.
  IRAS. Go, you wild bedfellow, you cannot soothsay.
  CHARMIAN. Nay, if an oily palm be not a fruitful prognostication, I
    cannot scratch mine ear. Prithee, tell her but worky-day fortune.
  SOOTHSAYER. Your fortunes are alike.
  IRAS. But how, but how? Give me particulars.
  SOOTHSAYER. I have said.
  IRAS. Am I not an inch of fortune better than she?
  CHARMIAN. Well, if you were but an inch of fortune better than I,
    where would you choose it?
  IRAS. Not in my husband's nose.
  CHARMIAN. Our worser thoughts heavens mend! Alexas- come, his
    fortune, his fortune! O, let him marry a woman that cannot go,
    sweet Isis, I beseech thee! And let her die too, and give him a
    worse! And let worse follow worse, till the worst of all follow
    him laughing to his grave, fiftyfold a cuckold! Good Isis, hear
    me this prayer, though thou deny me a matter of more weight; good
    Isis, I beseech thee!
  IRAS. Amen. Dear goddess, hear that prayer of the people! For, as
    it is a heartbreaking to see a handsome man loose-wiv'd, so it is
    a deadly sorrow to behold a foul knave uncuckolded. Therefore,
    dear Isis, keep decorum, and fortune him accordingly!
  CHARMIAN. Amen.
  ALEXAS. Lo now, if it lay in their hands to make me a cuckold, they
    would make themselves whores but they'ld do't!

                          Enter CLEOPATRA

  ENOBARBUS. Hush! Here comes Antony.
  CHARMIAN. Not he; the Queen.
  CLEOPATRA. Saw you my lord?
  ENOBARBUS. No, lady.
  CLEOPATRA. Was he not here?
  CHARMIAN. No, madam.
  CLEOPATRA. He was dispos'd to mirth; but on the sudden
    A Roman thought hath struck him. Enobarbus!
  ENOBARBUS. Madam?
  CLEOPATRA. Seek him, and bring him hither. Where's Alexas?
  ALEXAS. Here, at your service. My lord approaches.

          Enter ANTONY, with a MESSENGER and attendants

  CLEOPATRA. We will not look upon him. Go with us.
                       Exeunt CLEOPATRA, ENOBARBUS, and the rest
  MESSENGER. Fulvia thy wife first came into the field.
  ANTONY. Against my brother Lucius?
  MESSENGER. Ay.
    But soon that war had end, and the time's state
    Made friends of them, jointing their force 'gainst Caesar,
    Whose better issue in the war from Italy
    Upon the first encounter drave them.
  ANTONY. Well, what worst?
  MESSENGER. The nature of bad news infects the teller.
  ANTONY. When it concerns the fool or coward. On!
    Things that are past are done with me. 'Tis thus:
    Who tells me true, though in his tale lie death,
    I hear him as he flatter'd.
  MESSENGER. Labienus-
    This is stiff news- hath with his Parthian force
    Extended Asia from Euphrates,
    His conquering banner shook from Syria
    To Lydia and to Ionia,
    Whilst-
  ANTONY. Antony, thou wouldst say.
  MESSENGER. O, my lord!
  ANTONY. Speak to me home; mince not the general tongue;
    Name Cleopatra as she is call'd in Rome.
    Rail thou in Fulvia's phrase, and taunt my faults
    With such full licence as both truth and malice
    Have power to utter. O, then we bring forth weeds
    When our quick minds lie still, and our ills told us
    Is as our earing. Fare thee well awhile.
  MESSENGER. At your noble pleasure.                        Exit
  ANTONY. From Sicyon, ho, the news! Speak there!
  FIRST ATTENDANT. The man from Sicyon- is there such an one?
  SECOND ATTENDANT. He stays upon your will.
  ANTONY. Let him appear.
    These strong Egyptian fetters I must break,
    Or lose myself in dotage.

                 Enter another MESSENGER with a letter

    What are you?
  SECOND MESSENGER. Fulvia thy wife is dead.
  ANTONY. Where died she?
  SECOND MESSENGER. In Sicyon.
    Her length of sickness, with what else more serious
    Importeth thee to know, this bears.       [Gives the letter]
  ANTONY. Forbear me.                             Exit MESSENGER
    There's a great spirit gone! Thus did I desire it.
    What our contempts doth often hurl from us
    We wish it ours again; the present pleasure,
    By revolution low'ring, does become
    The opposite of itself. She's good, being gone;
    The hand could pluck her back that shov'd her on.
    I must from this enchanting queen break off.
    Ten thousand harms, more than the ills I know,
    My idleness doth hatch. How now, Enobarbus!

                    Re-enter ENOBARBUS

  ENOBARBUS. What's your pleasure, sir?
  ANTONY. I must with haste from hence.
  ENOBARBUS. Why, then we kill all our women. We see how mortal an
    unkindness is to them; if they suffer our departure, death's the
    word.
  ANTONY. I must be gone.
  ENOBARBUS. Under a compelling occasion, let women die. It were pity
    to cast them away for nothing, though between them and a great
    cause they should be esteemed nothing. Cleopatra, catching but
    the least noise of this, dies instantly; I have seen her die
    twenty times upon far poorer moment. I do think there is mettle
    in death, which commits some loving act upon her, she hath such a
    celerity in dying.
  ANTONY. She is cunning past man's thought.
  ENOBARBUS. Alack, sir, no! Her passions are made of nothing but the
    finest part of pure love. We cannot call her winds and waters
    sighs and tears; they are greater storms and tempests than
    almanacs can report. This cannot be cunning in her; if it be, she
    makes a show'r of rain as well as Jove.
  ANTONY. Would I had never seen her!
  ENOBARBUS. O Sir, you had then left unseen a wonderful piece of
    work, which not to have been blest withal would have discredited
    your travel.
  ANTONY. Fulvia is dead.
  ENOBARBUS. Sir?
  ANTONY. Fulvia is dead.
  ENOBARBUS. Fulvia?
  ANTONY. Dead.
  ENOBARBUS. Why, sir, give the gods a thankful sacrifice. When it
    pleaseth their deities to take the wife of a man from him, it
    shows to man the tailors of the earth; comforting therein that
    when old robes are worn out there are members to make new. If
    there were no more women but Fulvia, then had you indeed a cut,
    and the case to be lamented. This grief is crown'd with
    consolation: your old smock brings forth a new petticoat; and
    indeed the tears live in an onion that should water this sorrow.
  ANTONY. The business she hath broached in the state
    Cannot endure my absence.
  ENOBARBUS. And the business you have broach'd here cannot be
    without you; especially that of Cleopatra's, which wholly depends
    on your abode.
  ANTONY. No more light answers. Let our officers
    Have notice what we purpose. I shall break
    The cause of our expedience to the Queen,
    And get her leave to part. For not alone
    The death of Fulvia, with more urgent touches,
    Do strongly speak to us; but the letters to
    Of many our contriving friends in Rome
    Petition us at home. Sextus Pompeius
    Hath given the dare to Caesar, and commands
    The empire of the sea; our slippery people,
    Whose love is never link'd to the deserver
    Till his deserts are past, begin to throw
    Pompey the Great and all his dignities
    Upon his son; who, high in name and power,
    Higher than both in blood and life, stands up
    For the main soldier; whose quality, going on,
    The sides o' th' world may danger. Much is breeding
    Which, like the courser's hair, hath yet but life
    And not a serpent's poison. Say our pleasure,
    To such whose place is under us, requires
    Our quick remove from hence.
  ENOBARBUS. I shall do't.                                Exeunt




SCENE III.
Alexandria. CLEOPATRA'S palace

Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and ALEXAS

  CLEOPATRA. Where is he?
  CHARMIAN. I did not see him since.
  CLEOPATRA. See where he is, who's with him, what he does.
    I did not send you. If you find him sad,
    Say I am dancing; if in mirth, report
    That I am sudden sick. Quick, and return.        Exit ALEXAS
  CHARMIAN. Madam, methinks, if you did love him dearly,
    You do not hold the method to enforce
    The like from him.
  CLEOPATRA. What should I do I do not?
  CHARMIAN. In each thing give him way; cross him in nothing.
  CLEOPATRA. Thou teachest like a fool- the way to lose him.
  CHARMIAN. Tempt him not so too far; I wish, forbear;
    In time we hate that which we often fear.

                            Enter ANTONY

    But here comes Antony.
  CLEOPATRA. I am sick and sullen.
  ANTONY. I am sorry to give breathing to my purpose-
  CLEOPATRA. Help me away, dear Charmian; I shall fall.
    It cannot be thus long; the sides of nature
    Will not sustain it.
  ANTONY. Now, my dearest queen-
  CLEOPATRA. Pray you, stand farther from me.
  ANTONY. What's the matter?
  CLEOPATRA. I know by that same eye there's some good news.
    What says the married woman? You may go.
    Would she had never given you leave to come!
    Let her not say 'tis I that keep you here-
    I have no power upon you; hers you are.
  ANTONY. The gods best know-
  CLEOPATRA. O, never was there queen
    So mightily betray'd! Yet at the first
    I saw the treasons planted.
  ANTONY. Cleopatra-
  CLEOPATRA. Why should I think you can be mine and true,
    Though you in swearing shake the throned gods,
    Who have been false to Fulvia? Riotous madness,
    To be entangled with those mouth-made vows,
    Which break themselves in swearing!
  ANTONY. Most sweet queen-
  CLEOPATRA. Nay, pray you seek no colour for your going,
    But bid farewell, and go. When you sued staying,
    Then was the time for words. No going then!
    Eternity was in our lips and eyes,
    Bliss in our brows' bent, none our parts so poor
    But was a race of heaven. They are so still,
    Or thou, the greatest soldier of the world,
    Art turn'd the greatest liar.
  ANTONY. How now, lady!
  CLEOPATRA. I would I had thy inches. Thou shouldst know
    There were a heart in Egypt.
  ANTONY. Hear me, queen:
    The strong necessity of time commands
    Our services awhile; but my full heart
    Remains in use with you. Our Italy
    Shines o'er with civil swords: Sextus Pompeius
    Makes his approaches to the port of Rome;
    Equality of two domestic powers
    Breed scrupulous faction; the hated, grown to strength,
    Are newly grown to love. The condemn'd Pompey,
    Rich in his father's honour, creeps apace
    Into the hearts of such as have not thrived
    Upon the present state, whose numbers threaten;
    And quietness, grown sick of rest, would purge
    By any desperate change. My more particular,
    And that which most with you should safe my going,
    Is Fulvia's death.
  CLEOPATRA. Though age from folly could not give me freedom,
     It does from childishness. Can Fulvia die?
  ANTONY. She's dead, my Queen.
    Look here, and at thy sovereign leisure read
    The garboils she awak'd. At the last, best.
    See when and where she died.
  CLEOPATRA. O most false love!
    Where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill
    With sorrowful water? Now I see, I see,
    In Fulvia's death how mine receiv'd shall be.
  ANTONY. Quarrel no more, but be prepar'd to know
    The purposes I bear; which are, or cease,
    As you shall give th' advice. By the fire
    That quickens Nilus' slime, I go from hence
    Thy soldier, servant, making peace or war
    As thou affects.
  CLEOPATRA. Cut my lace, Charmian, come!
    But let it be; I am quickly ill and well-
    So Antony loves.
  ANTONY. My precious queen, forbear,
    And give true evidence to his love, which stands
    An honourable trial.
  CLEOPATRA. So Fulvia told me.
    I prithee turn aside and weep for her;
    Then bid adieu to me, and say the tears
    Belong to Egypt. Good now, play one scene
    Of excellent dissembling, and let it look
    Like perfect honour.
  ANTONY. You'll heat my blood; no more.
  CLEOPATRA. You can do better yet; but this is meetly.
  ANTONY. Now, by my sword-
  CLEOPATRA. And target. Still he mends;
    But this is not the best. Look, prithee, Charmian,
    How this Herculean Roman does become
    The carriage of his chafe.
  ANTONY. I'll leave you, lady.
  CLEOPATRA. Courteous lord, one word.
    Sir, you and I must part- but that's not it.
    Sir, you and I have lov'd- but there's not it.
    That you know well. Something it is I would-
    O, my oblivion is a very Antony,
    And I am all forgotten!
  ANTONY. But that your royalty
    Holds idleness your subject, I should take you
    For idleness itself.
  CLEOPATRA. 'Tis sweating labour
    To bear such idleness so near the heart
    As Cleopatra this. But, sir, forgive me;
    Since my becomings kill me when they do not
    Eye well to you. Your honour calls you hence;
    Therefore be deaf to my unpitied folly,
    And all the gods go with you! Upon your sword
    Sit laurel victory, and smooth success
    Be strew'd before your feet!
  ANTONY. Let us go. Come.
    Our separation so abides and flies
    That thou, residing here, goes yet with me,
    And I, hence fleeting, here remain with thee.
    Away!                                                 Exeunt




SCENE IV.
Rome. CAESAR'S house

Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, reading a letter; LEPIDUS, and their train

  CAESAR. You may see, Lepidus, and henceforth know,
    It is not Caesar's natural vice to hate
    Our great competitor. From Alexandria
    This is the news: he fishes, drinks, and wastes
    The lamps of night in revel; is not more manlike
    Than Cleopatra, nor the queen of Ptolemy
    More womanly than he; hardly gave audience, or
    Vouchsaf'd to think he had partners. You shall find there
    A man who is the abstract of all faults
    That all men follow.
  LEPIDUS. I must not think there are
    Evils enow to darken all his goodness.
    His faults, in him, seem as the spots of heaven,
    More fiery by night's blackness; hereditary
    Rather than purchas'd; what he cannot change
    Than what he chooses.
  CAESAR. You are too indulgent. Let's grant it is not
    Amiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy,
    To give a kingdom for a mirth, to sit
    And keep the turn of tippling with a slave,
    To reel the streets at noon, and stand the buffet
    With knaves that smell of sweat. Say this becomes him-
    As his composure must be rare indeed
    Whom these things cannot blemish- yet must Antony
    No way excuse his foils when we do bear
    So great weight in his lightness. If he fill'd
    His vacancy with his voluptuousness,
    Full surfeits and the dryness of his bones
    Call on him for't! But to confound such time
    That drums him from his sport and speaks as loud
    As his own state and ours- 'tis to be chid
    As we rate boys who, being mature in knowledge,
    Pawn their experience to their present pleasure,
    And so rebel to judgment.

                   Enter a MESSENGER

  LEPIDUS. Here's more news.
  MESSENGER. Thy biddings have been done; and every hour,
    Most noble Caesar, shalt thou have report
    How 'tis abroad. Pompey is strong at sea,
    And it appears he is belov'd of those
    That only have fear'd Caesar. To the ports
    The discontents repair, and men's reports
    Give him much wrong'd.
  CAESAR. I should have known no less.
    It hath been taught us from the primal state
    That he which is was wish'd until he were;
    And the ebb'd man, ne'er lov'd till ne'er worth love,
    Comes dear'd by being lack'd. This common body,
    Like to a vagabond flag upon the stream,
    Goes to and back, lackeying the varying tide,
    To rot itself with motion.
  MESSENGER. Caesar, I bring thee word
    Menecrates and Menas, famous pirates,
    Make the sea serve them, which they ear and wound
    With keels of every kind. Many hot inroads
    They make in Italy; the borders maritime
    Lack blood to think on't, and flush youth revolt.
    No vessel can peep forth but 'tis as soon
    Taken as seen; for Pompey's name strikes more
    Than could his war resisted.
  CAESAR. Antony,
    Leave thy lascivious wassails. When thou once
    Was beaten from Modena, where thou slew'st
    Hirtius and Pansa, consuls, at thy heel
    Did famine follow; whom thou fought'st against,
    Though daintily brought up, with patience more
    Than savages could suffer. Thou didst drink
    The stale of horses and the gilded puddle
    Which beasts would cough at. Thy palate then did deign
    The roughest berry on the rudest hedge;
    Yea, like the stag when snow the pasture sheets,
    The barks of trees thou brows'd. On the Alps
    It is reported thou didst eat strange flesh,
    Which some did die to look on. And all this-
    It wounds thine honour that I speak it now-
    Was borne so like a soldier that thy cheek
    So much as lank'd not.
  LEPIDUS. 'Tis pity of him.
  CAESAR. Let his shames quickly
    Drive him to Rome. 'Tis time we twain
    Did show ourselves i' th' field; and to that end
    Assemble we immediate council. Pompey
    Thrives in our idleness.
  LEPIDUS. To-morrow, Caesar,
    I shall be furnish'd to inform you rightly
    Both what by sea and land I can be able
    To front this present time.
  CAESAR. Till which encounter
    It is my business too. Farewell.
  LEPIDUS. Farewell, my lord. What you shall know meantime
    Of stirs abroad, I shall beseech you, sir,
    To let me be partaker.
  CAESAR. Doubt not, sir;
    I knew it for my bond.                                Exeunt




SCENE V.
Alexandria. CLEOPATRA'S palace

Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and MARDIAN

  CLEOPATRA. Charmian!
  CHARMIAN. Madam?
  CLEOPATRA. Ha, ha!
    Give me to drink mandragora.
  CHARMIAN. Why, madam?
  CLEOPATRA. That I might sleep out this great gap of time
    My Antony is away.
  CHARMIAN. You think of him too much.
  CLEOPATRA. O, 'tis treason!
  CHARMIAN. Madam, I trust, not so.
  CLEOPATRA. Thou, eunuch Mardian!
  MARDIAN. What's your Highness' pleasure?
  CLEOPATRA. Not now to hear thee sing; I take no pleasure
    In aught an eunuch has. 'Tis well for thee
    That, being unseminar'd, thy freer thoughts
    May not fly forth of Egypt. Hast thou affections?
  MARDIAN. Yes, gracious madam.
  CLEOPATRA. Indeed?
  MARDIAN. Not in deed, madam; for I can do nothing
    But what indeed is honest to be done.
    Yet have I fierce affections, and think
    What Venus did with Mars.
  CLEOPATRA. O Charmian,
    Where think'st thou he is now? Stands he or sits he?
    Or does he walk? or is he on his horse?
    O happy horse, to bear the weight of Antony!
    Do bravely, horse; for wot'st thou whom thou mov'st?
    The demi-Atlas of this earth, the arm
    And burgonet of men. He's speaking now,
    Or murmuring 'Where's my serpent of old Nile?'
    For so he calls me. Now I feed myself
    With most delicious poison. Think on me,
    That am with Phoebus' amorous pinches black,
    And wrinkled deep in time? Broad-fronted Caesar,
    When thou wast here above the ground, I was
    A morsel for a monarch; and great Pompey
    Would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow;
    There would he anchor his aspect and die
    With looking on his life.

                         Enter ALEXAS

  ALEXAS. Sovereign of Egypt, hail!
  CLEOPATRA. How much unlike art thou Mark Antony!
    Yet, coming from him, that great med'cine hath
    With his tinct gilded thee.
    How goes it with my brave Mark Antony?
  ALEXAS. Last thing he did, dear Queen,
    He kiss'd- the last of many doubled kisses-
    This orient pearl. His speech sticks in my heart.
  CLEOPATRA. Mine ear must pluck it thence.
  ALEXAS. 'Good friend,' quoth he
    'Say the firm Roman to great Egypt sends
    This treasure of an oyster; at whose foot,
    To mend the petty present, I will piece
    Her opulent throne with kingdoms. All the East,
    Say thou, shall call her mistress.' So he nodded,
    And soberly did mount an arm-gaunt steed,
    Who neigh'd so high that what I would have spoke
    Was beastly dumb'd by him.
  CLEOPATRA. What, was he sad or merry?
  ALEXAS. Like to the time o' th' year between the extremes
    Of hot and cold; he was nor sad nor merry.
  CLEOPATRA. O well-divided disposition! Note him,
    Note him, good Charmian; 'tis the man; but note him!
    He was not sad, for he would shine on those
    That make their looks by his; he was not merry,
    Which seem'd to tell them his remembrance lay
    In Egypt with his joy; but between both.
    O heavenly mingle! Be'st thou sad or merry,
    The violence of either thee becomes,
    So does it no man else. Met'st thou my posts?
  ALEXAS. Ay, madam, twenty several messengers.
    Why do you send so thick?
  CLEOPATRA. Who's born that day
    When I forget to send to Antony
    Shall die a beggar. Ink and paper, Charmian.
    Welcome, my good Alexas. Did I, Charmian,
    Ever love Caesar so?
  CHARMIAN. O that brave Caesar!
  CLEOPATRA. Be chok'd with such another emphasis!
    Say 'the brave Antony.'
  CHARMIAN. The valiant Caesar!
  CLEOPATRA. By Isis, I will give thee bloody teeth
    If thou with Caesar paragon again
    My man of men.
  CHARMIAN. By your most gracious pardon,
    I sing but after you.
  CLEOPATRA. My salad days,
    When I was green in judgment, cold in blood,
    To say as I said then. But come, away!
    Get me ink and paper.
    He shall have every day a several greeting,
    Or I'll unpeople Egypt.                               Exeunt

ACT II. SCENE I.
Messina. POMPEY'S house

Enter POMPEY, MENECRATES, and MENAS, in warlike manner

  POMPEY. If the great gods be just, they shall assist
    The deeds of justest men.
  MENECRATES. Know, worthy Pompey,
    That what they do delay they not deny.
  POMPEY. Whiles we are suitors to their throne, decays
    The thing we sue for.
  MENECRATES. We, ignorant of ourselves,
    Beg often our own harms, which the wise pow'rs
    Deny us for our good; so find we profit
    By losing of our prayers.
  POMPEY. I shall do well.
    The people love me, and the sea is mine;
    My powers are crescent, and my auguring hope
    Says it will come to th' full. Mark Antony
    In Egypt sits at dinner, and will make
    No wars without doors. Caesar gets money where
    He loses hearts. Lepidus flatters both,
    Of both is flatter'd; but he neither loves,
    Nor either cares for him.
  MENAS. Caesar and Lepidus
    Are in the field. A mighty strength they carry.
  POMPEY. Where have you this? 'Tis false.
  MENAS. From Silvius, sir.
  POMPEY. He dreams. I know they are in Rome together,
    Looking for Antony. But all the charms of love,
    Salt Cleopatra, soften thy wan'd lip!
    Let witchcraft join with beauty, lust with both;
    Tie up the libertine in a field of feasts,
    Keep his brain fuming. Epicurean cooks
    Sharpen with cloyless sauce his appetite,
    That sleep and feeding may prorogue his honour
    Even till a Lethe'd dullness-

                       Enter VARRIUS

    How now, Varrius!
  VARRIUS. This is most certain that I shall deliver:
    Mark Antony is every hour in Rome
    Expected. Since he went from Egypt 'tis
    A space for farther travel.
  POMPEY. I could have given less matter
    A better ear. Menas, I did not think
    This amorous surfeiter would have donn'd his helm
    For such a petty war; his soldiership
    Is twice the other twain. But let us rear
    The higher our opinion, that our stirring
    Can from the lap of Egypt's widow pluck
    The ne'er-lust-wearied Antony.
  MENAS. I cannot hope
    Caesar and Antony shall well greet together.
    His wife that's dead did trespasses to Caesar;
    His brother warr'd upon him; although, I think,
    Not mov'd by Antony.
  POMPEY. I know not, Menas,
    How lesser enmities may give way to greater.
    Were't not that we stand up against them all,
    'Twere pregnant they should square between themselves;
    For they have entertained cause enough
    To draw their swords. But how the fear of us
    May cement their divisions, and bind up
    The petty difference we yet not know.
    Be't as our gods will have't! It only stands
    Our lives upon to use our strongest hands.
    Come, Menas.                                          Exeunt




SCENE II.
Rome. The house of LEPIDUS

Enter ENOBARBUS and LEPIDUS

  LEPIDUS. Good Enobarbus, 'tis a worthy deed,
    And shall become you well, to entreat your captain
    To soft and gentle speech.
  ENOBARBUS. I shall entreat him
    To answer like himself. If Caesar move him,
    Let Antony look over Caesar's head
    And speak as loud as Mars. By Jupiter,
    Were I the wearer of Antonius' beard,
    I would not shave't to-day.
  LEPIDUS. 'Tis not a time
    For private stomaching.
  ENOBARBUS. Every time
    Serves for the matter that is then born in't.
  LEPIDUS. But small to greater matters must give way.
  ENOBARBUS. Not if the small come first.
  LEPIDUS. Your speech is passion;
    But pray you stir no embers up. Here comes
    The noble Antony.

                Enter ANTONY and VENTIDIUS

  ENOBARBUS. And yonder, Caesar.

            Enter CAESAR, MAECENAS, and AGRIPPA

  ANTONY. If we compose well here, to Parthia.
    Hark, Ventidius.
  CAESAR. I do not know, Maecenas. Ask Agrippa.
  LEPIDUS. Noble friends,
    That which combin'd us was most great, and let not
    A leaner action rend us. What's amiss,
    May it be gently heard. When we debate
    Our trivial difference loud, we do commit
    Murder in healing wounds. Then, noble partners,
    The rather for I earnestly beseech,
    Touch you the sourest points with sweetest terms,
    Nor curstness grow to th' matter.
  ANTONY. 'Tis spoken well.
    Were we before our arinies, and to fight,
    I should do thus.                                 [Flourish]
  CAESAR. Welcome to Rome.
  ANTONY. Thank you.
  CAESAR. Sit.
  ANTONY. Sit, sir.
  CAESAR. Nay, then.                                  [They sit]
  ANTONY. I learn you take things ill which are not so,
    Or being, concern you not.
  CAESAR. I must be laugh'd at
    If, or for nothing or a little,
    Should say myself offended, and with you
    Chiefly i' the world; more laugh'd at that I should
    Once name you derogately when to sound your name
    It not concern'd me.
  ANTONY. My being in Egypt, Caesar,
    What was't to you?
  CAESAR. No more than my residing here at Rome
    Might be to you in Egypt. Yet, if you there
    Did practise on my state, your being in Egypt
    Might be my question.
  ANTONY. How intend you- practis'd?
  CAESAR. You may be pleas'd to catch at mine intent
    By what did here befall me. Your wife and brother
    Made wars upon me, and their contestation
    Was theme for you; you were the word of war.
  ANTONY. You do mistake your business; my brother never
    Did urge me in his act. I did inquire it,
    And have my learning from some true reports
    That drew their swords with you. Did he not rather
    Discredit my authority with yours,
    And make the wars alike against my stomach,
    Having alike your cause? Of this my letters
    Before did satisfy you. If you'll patch a quarrel,
    As matter whole you have not to make it with,
    It must not be with this.
  CAESAR. You praise yourself
    By laying defects of judgment to me; but
    You patch'd up your excuses.
  ANTONY. Not so, not so;
    I know you could not lack, I am certain on't,
    Very necessity of this thought, that I,
    Your partner in the cause 'gainst which he fought,
    Could not with graceful eyes attend those wars
    Which fronted mine own peace. As for my wife,
    I would you had her spirit in such another!
    The third o' th' world is yours, which with a snaffle
    You may pace easy, but not such a wife.
  ENOBARBUS. Would we had all such wives, that the men might go to
    wars with the women!
  ANTONY. So much uncurbable, her garboils, Caesar,
    Made out of her impatience- which not wanted
    Shrewdness of policy too- I grieving grant
    Did you too much disquiet. For that you must
    But say I could not help it.
  CAESAR. I wrote to you
    When rioting in Alexandria; you
    Did pocket up my letters, and with taunts
    Did gibe my missive out of audience.
  ANTONY. Sir,
    He fell upon me ere admitted. Then
    Three kings I had newly feasted, and did want
    Of what I was i' th' morning; but next day
    I told him of myself, which was as much
    As to have ask'd him pardon. Let this fellow
    Be nothing of our strife; if we contend,
    Out of our question wipe him.
  CAESAR. You have broken
    The article of your oath, which you shall never
    Have tongue to charge me with.
  LEPIDUS. Soft, Caesar!
  ANTONY. No;
    Lepidus, let him speak.
    The honour is sacred which he talks on now,
    Supposing that I lack'd it. But on, Caesar:
    The article of my oath-
  CAESAR. To lend me arms and aid when I requir'd them,
    The which you both denied.
  ANTONY. Neglected, rather;
    And then when poisoned hours had bound me up
    From mine own knowledge. As nearly as I may,
    I'll play the penitent to you; but mine honesty
    Shall not make poor my greatness, nor my power
    Work without it. Truth is, that Fulvia,
    To have me out of Egypt, made wars here;
    For which myself, the ignorant motive, do
    So far ask pardon as befits mine honour
    To stoop in such a case.
  LEPIDUS. 'Tis noble spoken.
  MAECENAS. If it might please you to enforce no further
    The griefs between ye- to forget them quite
    Were to remember that the present need
    Speaks to atone you.
  LEPIDUS. Worthily spoken, Maecenas.
  ENOBARBUS. Or, if you borrow one another's love for the instant,
    you may, when you hear no more words of Pompey, return it again.
    You shall have time to wrangle in when you have nothing else to
    do.
  ANTONY. Thou art a soldier only. Speak no more.
  ENOBARBUS. That truth should be silent I had almost forgot.
  ANTONY. You wrong this presence; therefore speak no more.
  ENOBARBUS. Go to, then- your considerate stone!
  CAESAR. I do not much dislike the matter, but
    The manner of his speech; for't cannot be
    We shall remain in friendship, our conditions
    So diff'ring in their acts. Yet if I knew
    What hoop should hold us stanch, from edge to edge
    O' th' world, I would pursue it.
  AGRIPPA. Give me leave, Caesar.
  CAESAR. Speak, Agrippa.
  AGRIPPA. Thou hast a sister by the mother's side,
    Admir'd Octavia. Great Mark Antony
    Is now a widower.
  CAESAR. Say not so, Agrippa.
    If Cleopatra heard you, your reproof
    Were well deserv'd of rashness.
  ANTONY. I am not married, Caesar. Let me hear
    Agrippa further speak.
  AGRIPPA. To hold you in perpetual amity,
    To make you brothers, and to knit your hearts
    With an unslipping knot, take Antony
    Octavia to his wife; whose beauty claims
    No worse a husband than the best of men;
    Whose virtue and whose general graces speak
    That which none else can utter. By this marriage
    All little jealousies, which now seem great,
    And all great fears, which now import their dangers,
    Would then be nothing. Truths would be tales,
    Where now half tales be truths. Her love to both
    Would each to other, and all loves to both,
    Draw after her. Pardon what I have spoke;
    For 'tis a studied, not a present thought,
    By duty ruminated.
  ANTONY. Will Caesar speak?
  CAESAR. Not till he hears how Antony is touch'd
    With what is spoke already.
  ANTONY. What power is in Agrippa,
    If I would say 'Agrippa, be it so,'
    To make this good?
  CAESAR. The power of Caesar, and
    His power unto Octavia.
  ANTONY. May I never
    To this good purpose, that so fairly shows,
    Dream of impediment! Let me have thy hand.
    Further this act of grace; and from this hour
    The heart of brothers govern in our loves
    And sway our great designs!
  CAESAR. There is my hand.
    A sister I bequeath you, whom no brother
    Did ever love so dearly. Let her live
    To join our kingdoms and our hearts; and never
    Fly off our loves again!
  LEPIDUS. Happily, amen!
  ANTONY. I did not think to draw my sword 'gainst Pompey;
    For he hath laid strange courtesies and great
    Of late upon me. I must thank him only,
    Lest my remembrance suffer ill report;
    At heel of that, defy him.
  LEPIDUS. Time calls upon's.
    Of us must Pompey presently be sought,
    Or else he seeks out us.
  ANTONY. Where lies he?
  CAESAR. About the Mount Misenum.
  ANTONY. What is his strength by land?
  CAESAR. Great and increasing; but by sea
    He is an absolute master.
  ANTONY. So is the fame.
    Would we had spoke together! Haste we for it.
    Yet, ere we put ourselves in arms, dispatch we
    The business we have talk'd of.
  CAESAR. With most gladness;
    And do invite you to my sister's view,
    Whither straight I'll lead you.
  ANTONY. Let us, Lepidus,
    Not lack your company.
  LEPIDUS. Noble Antony,
    Not sickness should detain me.                    [Flourish]
                     Exeunt all but ENOBARBUS, AGRIPPA, MAECENAS
  MAECENAS. Welcome from Egypt, sir.
  ENOBARBUS. Half the heart of Caesar, worthy Maecenas! My honourable
    friend, Agrippa!
  AGRIPPA. Good Enobarbus!
  MAECENAS. We have cause to be glad that matters are so well
    digested. You stay'd well by't in Egypt.
  ENOBARBUS. Ay, sir; we did sleep day out of countenance and made
    the night light with drinking.
  MAECENAS. Eight wild boars roasted whole at a breakfast, and but
    twelve persons there. Is this true?
  ENOBARBUS. This was but as a fly by an eagle. We had much more
    monstrous matter of feast, which worthily deserved noting.
  MAECENAS. She's a most triumphant lady, if report be square to her.
  ENOBARBUS. When she first met Mark Antony she purs'd up his heart,
    upon the river of Cydnus.
  AGRIPPA. There she appear'd indeed! Or my reporter devis'd well for
    her.
  ENOBARBUS. I will tell you.
    The barge she sat in, like a burnish'd throne,
    Burn'd on the water. The poop was beaten gold;
    Purple the sails, and so perfumed that
    The winds were love-sick with them; the oars were silver,
    Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made
    The water which they beat to follow faster,
    As amorous of their strokes. For her own person,
    It beggar'd all description. She did lie
    In her pavilion, cloth-of-gold, of tissue,
    O'erpicturing that Venus where we see
    The fancy out-work nature. On each side her
    Stood pretty dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids,
    With divers-colour'd fans, whose wind did seem
    To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool,
    And what they undid did.
  AGRIPPA. O, rare for Antony!
  ENOBARBUS. Her gentlewomen, like the Nereides,
    So many mermaids, tended her i' th' eyes,
    And made their bends adornings. At the helm
    A seeming mermaid steers. The silken tackle
    Swell with the touches of those flower-soft hands
    That yarely frame the office. From the barge
    A strange invisible perfume hits the sense
    Of the adjacent wharfs. The city cast
    Her people out upon her; and Antony,
    Enthron'd i' th' market-place, did sit alone,
    Whistling to th' air; which, but for vacancy,
    Had gone to gaze on Cleopatra too,
    And made a gap in nature.
  AGRIPPA. Rare Egyptian!
  ENOBARBUS. Upon her landing, Antony sent to her,
    Invited her to supper. She replied
    It should be better he became her guest;
    Which she entreated. Our courteous Antony,
    Whom ne'er the word of 'No' woman heard speak,
    Being barber'd ten times o'er, goes to the feast,
    And for his ordinary pays his heart
    For what his eyes eat only.
  AGRIPPA. Royal wench!
    She made great Caesar lay his sword to bed.
    He ploughed her, and she cropp'd.
  ENOBARBUS. I saw her once
    Hop forty paces through the public street;
    And, having lost her breath, she spoke, and panted,
    That she did make defect perfection,
    And, breathless, pow'r breathe forth.
  MAECENAS. Now Antony must leave her utterly.
  ENOBARBUS. Never! He will not.
    Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale
    Her infinite variety. Other women cloy
    The appetites they feed, but she makes hungry
    Where most she satisfies; for vilest things
    Become themselves in her, that the holy priests
    Bless her when she is riggish.
  MAECENAS. If beauty, wisdom, modesty, can settle
    The heart of Antony, Octavia is
    A blessed lottery to him.
  AGRIPPA. Let us go.
    Good Enobarbus, make yourself my guest
    Whilst you abide here.
  ENOBARBUS. Humbly, sir, I thank you.
